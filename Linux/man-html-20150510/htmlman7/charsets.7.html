      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p>This manual page gives an overview on different character
      set standards and how they were used on Linux before Unicode
      became ubiquitous. Some of this information is still helpful
      for people working with legacy systems and documents.</p>

      <p>Standards discussed include such as ASCII, GB 2312, ISO
      8859, JIS, KOI8-R, KS, and Unicode.</p>

      <p>The primary emphasis is on character sets that were
      actually used by locale character sets, not the myriad others
      that could be found in data from other systems.</p>

        <h3>ASCII</h3>

        <p>ASCII (American Standard Code For Information
        Interchange) is the original 7-bit character set,
        originally designed for American English. Also known as
        US-ASCII. It is currently described by the ISO 646:1991 IRV
        (International Reference Version) standard.</p>

        <p>Various ASCII variants replacing the dollar sign with
        other currency symbols and replacing punctuation with
        non-English alphabetic characters to cover German, French,
        Spanish, and others in 7 bits emerged. All are deprecated;
        glibc does not support locales whose character sets are not
        true supersets of ASCII.</p>

        <p>As Unicode, when using UTF-8, is ASCII-compatible, plain
        ASCII text still renders properly on modern UTF-8 using
        systems.</p>

        <h3>ISO 8859</h3>

        <p>ISO 8859 is a series of 15 8-bit character sets, all of
        which have ASCII in their low (7-bit) half, invisible
        control characters in positions 128 to 159, and 96
        fixed-width graphics in positions 160-255.</p>

        <p>Of these, the most important is ISO 8859-1 ("Latin
        Alphabet No .1" / Latin-1). It was widely adopted and
        supported by different systems, and is gradually being
        replaced with Unicode. The ISO 8859-1 characters are also
        the first 256 characters of Unicode.</p>

        <p>Console support for the other 8859 character sets is
        available under Linux through user-mode utilities (such as
        <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">setfont</span>(8)</span>) that modify
        keyboard bindings and the EGA graphics table and employ the
        "user mapping" font table in the console driver.</p>

        <p>Here are brief descriptions of each set:</p>

            <dd>
              <p>Latin-1 covers many West European languages such
              as Albanian, Basque, Danish, English, Faroese,
              Galician, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Norwegian,
              Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. The lack of the
              ligatures Dutch Ĳ/ĳ, French œ, and
              old-style „German“ quotation marks was
              considered tolerable.</p>

              Czech, German, Hungarian, Polish, Slovak, and
              Slovene. Replacing Romanian ș/ț with
              ş/ţ was considered tolerable.</p>

            <dd>
              <p>Latin-3 was designed to cover of Esperanto,
              Maltese, and Turkish, but 8859-9 later superseded it
              for Turkish.</p>

            <dt><span class="term">8859-4 (Latin-4)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Latin-4 introduced letters for North European
              languages such as Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian,
              but was superseded by 8859-10 and 8859-13.</p>

              <p>Was created for Arabic. The 8859-6 glyph table is
              a fixed font of separate letter forms, but a proper

            <dd>
              <p>Supports Modern Hebrew without niqud (punctuation
              signs). Niqud and full-fledged Biblical Hebrew were
              outside the scope of this character set.</p>

            <dd>
              <p>Supports the Baltic Rim languages; in particular,
              it includes Latvian characters not found in
              Latin-4.</p>
            </dd>

            <dd>
              <p>This is the Celtic character set, covering Old

            <dt><span class="term">8859-15 (Latin-9)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Latin-9 is similar to the widely used Latin-1 but
              replaces some less common symbols with the Euro sign
              and French and Finnish letters that were missing in
              Latin-1.</p>

        <h3>KOI8-R / KOI8-U</h3>

        <p>KOI8-R is a non-ISO character set popular in Russia
        before Unicode. The lower half is ASCII; the upper is a
        Cyrillic character set somewhat better designed than ISO
        8859-5. KOI8-U, based on KOI8-R, has better support for
        Ukrainian. Neither of these sets are ISO-2022 compatible,
        unlike the ISO-8859 series.</p>

        <p>Console support for KOI8-R is available under Linux
        through user-mode utilities that modify keyboard bindings
        and the EGA graphics table, and employ the "user mapping"
        font table in the console driver.</p>

        <h3>GB 2312</h3>

        <p>GB 2312 is a mainland Chinese national standard
        character set used to express simplified Chinese. Just like
        JIS X 0208, characters are mapped into a 94x94 two-byte
        matrix used to construct EUC-CN. EUC-CN is the most
        important encoding for Linux and includes ASCII and GB
        2312. Note that EUC-CN is often called as GB, GB 2312, or
        CN-GB.</p>

        <h3>Big5</h3>

        <p>Big5 was a popular character set in Taiwan to express
        traditional Chinese. (Big5 is both a character set and an
        encoding.) It is a superset of ASCII. Non-ASCII characters
        are expressed in two bytes. Bytes 0xa1-0xfe are used as
        leading bytes for two-byte characters. Big5 and its
        extension were widely used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. It is
        not ISO 2022 compliant.</p>

        <h3>JIS X 0208</h3>

        <p>JIS X 0208 is a Japanese national standard character
        set. Though there are some more Japanese national standard
        character sets (like JIS X 0201, JIS X 0212, and JIS X
        0213), this is the most important one. Characters are
        mapped into a 94x94 two-byte matrix, whose each byte is in
        the range 0x21-0x7e. Note that JIS X 0208 is a character
        set, not an encoding. This means that JIS X 0208 itself is
        not used for expressing text data. JIS X 0208 is used as a
        component to construct encodings such as EUC-JP, Shift_JIS,
        and ISO-2022-JP. EUC-JP is the most important encoding for
        Linux and includes ASCII and JIS X 0208. In EUC-JP, JIS X
        0208 characters are expressed in two bytes, each of which
        is the JIS X 0208 code plus 0x80.</p>

        <h3>KS X 1001</h3>

        <p>KS X 1001 is a Korean national standard character set.
        Just as JIS X 0208, characters are mapped into a 94x94
        two-byte matrix. KS X 1001 is used like JIS X 0208, as a
        component to construct encodings such as EUC-KR, Johab, and
        ISO-2022-KR. EUC-KR is the most important encoding for
        Linux and includes ASCII and KS X 1001. KS C 5601 is an
        older name for KS X 1001.</p>

        <h3>ISO 2022 and ISO 4873</h3>

        <p>The ISO 2022 and 4873 standards describe a font-control
        model based on VT100 practice. This model is (partially)
        supported by the Linux kernel and by <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">xterm</span>(1)</span>. Several ISO
        2022-based character encodings have been defined,
        especially for Japanese.</p>

        <p>There are 4 graphic character sets, called G0, G1, G2,
        and G3, and one of them is the current character set for
        codes with high bit zero (initially G0), and one of them is
        the current character set for codes with high bit one
        (initially G1). Each graphic character set has 94 or 96
        characters, and is essentially a 7-bit character set. It
        uses codes either 040-0177 (041-0176) or 0240-0377
        (0241-0376). G0 always has size 94 and uses codes
        041-0176.</p>

        <p>Switching between character sets is done using the shift
        functions <code class="literal">^N</code> (SO or LS1),
        <code class="literal">^O</code> (SI or LS0), ESC n (LS2),
        ESC o (LS3), ESC N (SS2), ESC O (SS3), ESC ~ (LS1R), ESC }
        (LS2R), ESC | (LS3R). The function LS<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> makes character set
        G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> the current
        one for codes with high bit zero. The function LS<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>R makes character set
        G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> the current
        one for codes with high bit one. The function SS<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> makes character set
        G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> (<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>=2 or 3) the current one
        for the next character only (regardless of the value of its
        high order bit).</p>

        <p>A 94-character set is designated as G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> character set by an
        escape sequence ESC ( xx (for G0), ESC ) xx (for G1), ESC *
        xx (for G2), ESC + xx (for G3), where xx is a symbol or a
        pair of symbols found in the ISO 2375 International
        Register of Coded Character Sets. For example, ESC ( @
        selects the ISO 646 character set as G0, ESC ( A selects
        the UK standard character set (with pound instead of number
        sign), ESC ( B selects ASCII (with dollar instead of
        currency sign), ESC ( M selects a character set for African
        languages, ESC ( ! A selects the Cuban character set, and
        so on.</p>

        <p>A 96-character set is designated as G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> character set by an
        escape sequence ESC − xx (for G1), ESC . xx (for G2)
        or ESC / xx (for G3). For example, ESC − G selects
        the Hebrew alphabet as G1.</p>

        <p>A multibyte character set is designated as G<em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em> character set by an
        escape sequence ESC $ xx or ESC $ ( xx (for G0), ESC $ ) xx
        (for G1), ESC $ * xx (for G2), ESC $ + xx (for G3). For
        example, ESC $ ( C selects the Korean character set for G0.
        The Japanese character set selected by ESC $ B has a more
        recent version selected by ESC &amp; @ ESC $ B.</p>

        <p>ISO 4873 stipulates a narrower use of character sets,
        where G0 is fixed (always ASCII), so that G1, G2 and G3 can
        be invoked only for codes with the high order bit set. In
        particular, <code class="literal">^N</code> and
        <code class="literal">^O</code> are not used anymore, ESC (
        xx can be used only with xx=B, and ESC ) xx, ESC * xx, ESC
        + xx are equivalent to ESC − xx, ESC . xx, ESC / xx,
        respectively.</p>

        <h3>TIS-620</h3>

        <p>TIS-620 is a Thai national standard character set and a
        superset of ASCII. In the same fashion as the ISO 8859
        series, Thai characters are mapped into 0xa1-0xfe.</p>

        <h3>Unicode</h3>

        <p>Unicode (ISO 10646) is a standard which aims to
        unambiguously represent every character in every human
        language. Unicode's structure permits 20.1 bits to encode
        every character. Since most computers don't include
        20.1-bit integers, Unicode is usually encoded as 32-bit
        integers internally and either a series of 16-bit integers
        (UTF-16) (needing two 16-bit integers only when encoding
        certain rare characters) or a series of 8-bit bytes
        (UTF-8).</p>

        <p>Linux represents Unicode using the 8-bit Unicode
        Transformation Format (UTF-8). UTF-8 is a variable length
        encoding of Unicode. It uses 1 byte to code 7 bits, 2 bytes
        for 11 bits, 3 bytes for 16 bits, 4 bytes for 21 bits, 5
        bytes for 26 bits, 6 bytes for 31 bits.</p>

        <p>Let 0,1,x stand for a zero, one, or arbitrary bit. A
        byte 0xxxxxxx stands for the Unicode 00000000 0xxxxxxx
        which codes the same symbol as the ASCII 0xxxxxxx. Thus,
        ASCII goes unchanged into UTF-8, and people using only
        ASCII do not notice any change: not in code, and not in
        file size.</p>

        <p>A byte 110xxxxx is the start of a 2-byte code, and
        110xxxxx 10yyyyyy is assembled into 00000xxx xxyyyyyy. A
        byte 1110xxxx is the start of a 3-byte code, and 1110xxxx
        10yyyyyy 10zzzzzz is assembled into xxxxyyyy yyzzzzzz.
        (When UTF-8 is used to code the 31-bit ISO 10646 then this
        progression continues up to 6-byte codes.)</p>

        <p>For most texts in ISO-8859 character sets, this means
        that the characters outside of ASCII are now coded with two
        bytes. This tends to expand ordinary text files by only one
        or two percent. For Russian or Greek texts, this expands
        ordinary text files by 100%, since text in those languages
        is mostly outside of ASCII. For Japanese users this means
        that the 16-bit codes now in common use will take three
        bytes. While there are algorithmic conversions from some
        character sets (especially ISO 8859-1) to Unicode, general
        conversion requires carrying around conversion tables,
        which can be quite large for 16-bit codes.</p>

        <p>Note that UTF-8 is self-synchronizing: 10xxxxxx is a
        tail, any other byte is the head of a code. Note that the
        only way ASCII bytes occur in a UTF-8 stream, is as
        themselves. In particular, there are no embedded NULs
        ('\0') or '/'s that form part of some larger code.</p>

        <p>Since ASCII, and, in particular, NUL and '/', are
        unchanged, the kernel does not notice that UTF-8 is being
        used. It does not care at all what the bytes it is handling
        stand for.</p>

        <p>Rendering of Unicode data streams is typically handled
        through "subfont" tables which map a subset of Unicode to
        glyphs. Internally the kernel uses Unicode to describe the
        subfont loaded in video RAM. This means that in the Linux
        console in UTF-8 mode, one can use a character set with 512
        different symbols. This is not enough for Japanese,
        Chinese, and Korean, but it is enough for most other
        purposes.</p>
