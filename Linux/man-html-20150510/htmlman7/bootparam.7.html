      <p>bootparam — introduction to boot time parameters of
      the Linux kernel</p>

      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p>The Linux kernel accepts certain 'command-line options' or
      'boot time parameters' at the moment it is started. In
      general this is used to supply the kernel with information
      about hardware parameters that the kernel would not be able
      to determine on its own, or to avoid/override the values that
      the kernel would otherwise detect.</p>

      <p>When the kernel is booted directly by the BIOS, you have
      no opportunity to specify any parameters. So, in order to
      take advantage of this possibility you have to use a boot
      loader that is able to pass parameters, such as GRUB.</p>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="bootparam-7_sect2" name="bootparam-7_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>The argument list</h3>

        <p>The kernel command line is parsed into a list of strings
        (boot arguments) separated by spaces. Most of the boot
        arguments have the form:</p>

        <div class="blockquote">
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
name[=value_1][,value_2]...[,value_10]
</pre>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>where 'name' is a unique keyword that is used to
        identify what part of the kernel the associated values (if
        any) are to be given to. Note the limit of 10 is real, as
        the present code handles only 10 comma separated parameters
        per keyword. (However, you can reuse the same keyword with
        up to an additional 10 parameters in unusually complicated
        situations, assuming the setup function supports it.)</p>

        <p>Most of the sorting is coded in the kernel source file
        <code class="filename">init/main.c</code>. First, the
        kernel checks to see if the argument is any of the special
        arguments 'root=', 'nfsroot=', 'nfsaddrs=', 'ro', 'rw',
        'debug' or 'init'. The meaning of these special arguments
        is described below.</p>

        <p>Then it walks a list of setup functions to see if the
        specified argument string (such as 'foo') has been
        associated with a setup function ('foo_setup()') for a
        particular device or part of the kernel. If you passed the
        kernel the line foo=3,4,5,6 then the kernel would search
        the bootsetups array to see if 'foo' was registered. If it
        was, then it would call the setup function associated with
        'foo' (foo_setup()) and hand it the arguments 3, 4, 5, and
        6 as given on the kernel command line.</p>

        <p>Anything of the form 'foo=bar' that is not accepted as a
        setup function as described above is then interpreted as an
        environment variable to be set. A (useless?) example would
        be to use 'TERM=vt100' as a boot argument.</p>

        <p>Any remaining arguments that were not picked up by the
        kernel and were not interpreted as environment variables
        are then passed onto PID 1, which is usually the
        <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">init</span>(1)</span> program. The most
        common argument that is passed to the <em class="replaceable"><code>init</code></em> process is the word
        'single' which instructs it to boot the computer in single
        user mode, and not launch all the usual daemons. Check the
        manual page for the version of <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">init</span>(1)</span> installed on your
        system to see what arguments it accepts.</p>

              <p>This sets the initial command to be executed by
              the kernel. If this is not set, or cannot be found,
              the kernel will try <code class="filename">/sbin/init</code>, then <code class="filename">/etc/init</code>, then <code class="filename">/bin/init</code>, then <code class="filename">/bin/sh</code> and panic if all of this
              fails.</p>

              <p>This sets the NFS boot address to the given

            <dt><span class="term">'nfsroot=...'</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This sets the NFS root name to the given string.
              If this string does not begin with '/' or ',' or a
              digit, then it is prefixed by '/tftpboot/'. This root
              name is used in case of a net boot.</p>

            <dt><span class="term">'root=...'</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This argument tells the kernel what device is to
              be used as the root filesystem while booting. The
              default of this setting is determined at compile
              time, and usually is the value of the root device of
              the system that the kernel was built on. To override
              this value, and select the second floppy drive as the
              root device, one would use 'root=/dev/fd1'.</p>

              <p>The root device can be specified symbolically or
              numerically. A symbolic specification has the form
              <code class="filename">/dev/XXYN</code>, where XX
              designates the device type (e.g., 'hd' for ST-506
              compatible hard disk, with Y in 'a'-'d'; 'sd' for
              SCSI compatible disk, with Y in 'a'-'e'), Y the
              driver letter or number, and N the number (in
              decimal) of the partition on this device.</p>

              <p>Note that this has nothing to do with the
              designation of these devices on your filesystem. The
              '/dev/' part is purely conventional.</p>

              <p>The more awkward and less portable numeric
              specification of the above possible root devices in
              major/minor format is also accepted. (For example,
              <code class="filename">/dev/sda3</code> is major 8,
              minor 3, so you could use 'root=0x803' as an
              alternative.)</p>

              <p>This parameter sets the delay (in seconds) to

              the root filesystem as if it where of the type
              specified. This can be useful (for example) to mount
              an ext3 filesystem as ext2 and then remove the
              journal in the root filesystem, in fact reverting its
              format from ext3 to ext2 without the need to boot the
              box from alternate media.</p>

              <p>The 'ro' option tells the kernel to mount the root
              filesystem as 'read-only' so that filesystem
              consistency check programs (fsck) can do their work
              on a quiescent filesystem. No processes can write to
              files on the filesystem in question until it is
              'remounted' as read/write capable, for example, by
              'mount −w −n −o remount /'. (See
              also <a class="link" href="../htmlman8/mount.8.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">mount</span>(8)</span></a>.)</p>

              <p>The 'rw' option tells the kernel to mount the root
              filesystem read/write. This is the default.</p>

              resume from after hibernation. Usually, it is the
              same as your swap partition or file. Example:</p>

              </div>

              <p>In some machines it may be necessary to prevent
              device drivers from checking for devices
              (auto-probing) in a specific region. This may be
              because of hardware that reacts badly to the probing,
              or hardware that would be mistakenly identified, or
              merely hardware you don't want the kernel to
              initialize.</p>

              <p>The reserve boot-time argument specifies an I/O
              port region that shouldn't be probed. A device driver
              will not probe a reserved region, unless another boot
              argument explicitly specifies that it do so.</p>

              In general it is a bad idea to use a ramdisk under
              Linux—the system will use available memory more
              efficiently itself. But while booting, it is often
              useful to load the floppy contents into a ramdisk.
              One might also have a system in which first some
              modules (for filesystem or hardware) must be loaded
              before the main disk can be accessed.</p>

              <p>In Linux 1.3.48, ramdisk handling was changed
              drastically. Earlier, the memory was allocated
              statically, and there was a 'ramdisk=N' parameter to
              tell its size. (This could also be set in the kernel
              image at compile time.) These days ram disks use the
              buffer cache, and grow dynamically. For a lot of
              information on the current ramdisk setup, see the
              kernel source file <code class="filename">Documentation/blockdev/ramdisk.txt</code>

        <h3>Boot arguments for SCSI devices</h3>

        <p>General notation for this section:</p>

        <p><em class="replaceable"><code>iobase</code></em> -- the
        first I/O port that the SCSI host occupies. These are
        specified in hexadecimal notation, and usually lie in the
        range from 0x200 to 0x3ff.</p>

        <p><em class="replaceable"><code>irq</code></em> -- the
        hardware interrupt that the card is configured to use.
        Valid values will be dependent on the card in question, but
        will usually be 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15. The other
        values are usually used for common peripherals like IDE
        hard disks, floppies, serial ports, and so on.</p>

        <p><em class="replaceable"><code>scsi-id</code></em> -- the
        ID that the host adapter uses to identify itself on the
        SCSI bus. Only some host adapters allow you to change this
        value, as most have it permanently specified internally.
        The usual default value is 7, but the Seagate and Future
        Domain TMC-950 boards use 6.</p>

        <p><em class="replaceable"><code>parity</code></em> --
        whether the SCSI host adapter expects the attached devices
        to supply a parity value with all information exchanges.
        Specifying a one indicates parity checking is enabled, and
        a zero disables parity checking. Again, not all adapters
        will support selection of parity behavior as a boot
        argument.</p>

        <div class="variablelist">

            <dd>
              <p>A SCSI device can have a number of 'subdevices'
              contained within itself. The most common example is
              one of the new SCSI CD-ROMs that handle more than one
              disk at a time. Each CD is addressed as a 'Logical
              Unit Number' (LUN) of that particular device. But
              most devices, such as hard disks, tape drives and
              such are only one device, and will be assigned to LUN
              zero.</p>

              <p>Some poorly designed SCSI devices cannot handle
              being probed for LUNs not equal to zero. Therefore,
              if the compile-time flag <code class="constant">CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN</code> is not set,
              newer kernels will by default probe only LUN
              zero.</p>

              <p>To specify the number of probed LUNs at boot, one
              enters 'max_scsi_luns=n' as a boot arg, where n is a
              number between one and eight. To avoid problems as
              described above, one would use n=1 to avoid upsetting
              such broken devices.</p>

        <p>Different drivers make use of different parameters, but
        they all at least share having an IRQ, an I/O port base
        value, and a name. In its most generic form, it looks

</pre>
            </div>
          </blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>The first nonnumeric argument is taken as the name. The
        param_n values (if applicable) usually have different
        meanings for each different card/driver. Typical param_n
        values are used to specify things like shared memory
        address, interface selection, DMA channel and the like.</p>

        <p>The most common use of this parameter is to force
        probing for a second ethercard, as the default is to probe
        only for one. This can be accomplished with a simple:</p>

        <div class="blockquote">

              recommended. Using a boot argument of 'sound=0' will
              disable the sound driver entirely.</p>

              <p>You can tell the printer driver what ports to use
              and what ports not to use. The latter comes in handy
              if you don't want the printer driver to claim all
              available parallel ports, so that other drivers
              (e.g., PLIP, PPA) can use them instead.</p>

              <p>The format of the argument is multiple port names.
              For example, lp=none,parport0 would use the first
              parallel port for lp1, and disable lp0. To disable
              the printer driver entirely, one can use lp=0.</p>
