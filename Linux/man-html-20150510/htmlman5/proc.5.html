      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p>The <code class="literal">proc</code> filesystem is a
      pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to kernel data
      structures. It is commonly mounted at <code class="filename">/proc</code>. Most of it is read-only, but some
      files allow kernel variables to be changed.</p>

        <h3>Mount options</h3>

        <p>The <code class="literal">proc</code> filesystem
        supports the following mount options:</p>

        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl class="variablelist">
            <dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">hidepid</code>=<code class="literal">n</code>
            (since Linux 3.3)</span></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>This option controls who can access the
              information in <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]</code> directories. The
              argument, <code class="literal">n</code>, is one of
              the following values:</p>

              <div class="blockquote">
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <div class="variablelist">
                    <dl class="variablelist">
                      <dt><span class="term"><code class="constant">0</code></span></dt>

                      <dd>
                        <p>Everybody may access all <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]</code> directories.
                        This is the traditional behavior, and the
                        default if this mount option is not
                        specified.</p>
                      </dd>

                        <p>Users may not access files and
                        subdirectories inside any <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]</code> directories
                        but their own (the <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]</code> directories
                        themselves remain visible). Sensitive files
                        such as <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]cmdline</code> and
                        <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]status</code> are now
                        protected against other users. This makes
                        it impossible to learn whether any user is
                        running a specific program (so long as the
                        program doesn't otherwise reveal itself by
                        its behavior).</p>

                        <p>As for mode 1, but in addition the
                        <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]</code>
                        directories belonging to other users become
                        invisible. This means that <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]</code> entries can
                        no longer be used to discover the PIDs on
                        the system. This doesn't hide the fact that
                        a process with a specific PID value exists
                        (it can be learned by other means, for
                        example, by "kill -0 $PID"), but it hides a
                        process's UID and GID, which could
                        otherwise be learned by employing <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/stat.2.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">stat</span>(2)</span></a>
                        on a <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]</code> directory.
                        This greatly complicates an attacker's task
                        of gathering information about running
                        processes (e.g., discovering whether some
                        daemon is running with elevated privileges,
                        whether another user is running some
                        sensitive program, whether other users are
                        running any program at all, and so on).</p>

              to support SELinux, but the intention was that the
              API be general enough to support other security
              modules. For the purpose of explanation, examples of

              <p>The contents of this file represent the current
              security attributes of the process.</p>

              <p>In SELinux, this file is used to get the security
              context of a process. Prior to Linux 2.6.11, this
              file could not be used to set the security context (a
              write was always denied), since SELinux limited
              process security transitions to <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/execve.2.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">execve</span>(2)</span></a> (see the
              description of <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]/attr/exec</code>, below).
              Since Linux 2.6.11, SELinux lifted this restriction
              and began supporting "set" operations via writes to
              this node if authorized by policy, although use of
              this operation is only suitable for applications that
              are trusted to maintain any desired separation
              between the old and new security contexts. Prior to
              Linux 2.6.28, SELinux did not allow threads within a
              multi-threaded process to set their security context
              via this node as it would yield an inconsistency
              among the security contexts of the threads sharing
              the same memory space. Since Linux 2.6.28, SELinux
              lifted this restriction and began supporting "set"
              operations for threads within a multithreaded process
              if the new security context is bounded by the old
              security context, where the bounded relation is
              defined in policy and guarantees that the new
              security context has a subset of the permissions of
              the old security context. Other security modules may
              choose to support "set" operations via writes to this
              node.</p>

              <p>In SELinux, this is needed to support role/domain

              <p>Clearing the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits
              provides a method to measure approximately how much
              memory a process is using. One first inspects the
              values in the "Referenced" fields for the VMAs shown
              in <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]/smaps</code> to
              get an idea of the memory footprint of the process.
              One then clears the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG
              bits and, after some measured time interval, once
              again inspects the values in the "Referenced" fields
              to get an idea of the change in memory footprint of
              the process during the measured interval. If one is
              interested only in inspecting the selected mapping
              types, then the value 2 or 3 can be used instead of
              1.</p>

              <p>The <code class="literal">offset</code> field is
              the offset into the file/whatever; <code class="literal">dev</code> is the device (major:minor);

              that device. 0 indicates that no inode is associated

              <p>The <code class="literal">pathname</code> field

              special value −17, which disables OOM-killing
              altogether for this process. A positive score

              <p>This file can be used to adjust the badness
              heuristic used to select which process gets killed in
              out-of-memory conditions.</p>

              <p>The badness heuristic assigns a value to each
              candidate task ranging from 0 (never kill) to 1000
              (always kill) to determine which process is targeted.
              The units are roughly a proportion along that range
              of allowed memory the process may allocate from,
              based on an estimation of its current memory and swap
              use. For example, if a task is using all allowed
              memory, its badness score will be 1000. If it is
              using half of its allowed memory, its score will be
              500.</p>

              <p>There is an additional factor included in the
              badness score: root processes are given 3% extra
              memory over other tasks.</p>

              <p>The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the
              context in which the OOM-killer was called. If it is
              due to the memory assigned to the allocating task's
              cpuset being exhausted, the allowed memory represents
              the set of mems assigned to that cpuset (see
              <a class="link" href="../htmlman7/cpuset.7.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">cpuset</span>(7)</span></a>). If it
              is due to a mempolicy's node(s) being exhausted, the
              allowed memory represents the set of mempolicy nodes.
              If it is due to a memory limit (or swap limit) being
              reached, the allowed memory is that configured limit.
              Finally, if it is due to the entire system being out
              of memory, the allowed memory represents all
              allocatable resources.</p>

              <p>The value of <code class="literal">oom_score_adj</code> is added to the
              badness score before it is used to determine which
              task to kill. Acceptable values range from
              −1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN) to +1000
              (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX). This allows user space to
              control the preference for OOM-killing, ranging from
              always preferring a certain task or completely
              disabling it from OOM killing. The lowest possible
              value, −1000, is equivalent to disabling
              OOM-killing entirely for that task, since it will
              always report a badness score of 0.</p>

              <p>Consequently, it is very simple for user space to
              define the amount of memory to consider for each
              task. Setting a <code class="literal">oom_score_adj</code> value of +500, for
              example, is roughly equivalent to allowing the
              remainder of tasks sharing the same system, cpuset,
              mempolicy, or memory controller resources to use at
              least 50% more memory. A value of −500, on the
              other hand, would be roughly equivalent to
              discounting 50% of the task's allowed memory from
              being considered as scoring against the task.</p>

              <p>For backward compatibility with previous kernels,
              <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]/oom_adj</code> can
              still be used to tune the badness score. Its value is
              scaled linearly with <code class="literal">oom_score_adj</code>.</p>

              <p>Writing to <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj</code> or
              <code class="filename">/proc/[pid]/oom_adj</code>
              will change the other with its scaled value.</p>

              <p>This file contains information which is used for
              diagnosing memory fragmentation issues. Each line
              starts with the identification of the node and the
              name of the zone which together identify a memory
              region This is then followed by the count of
              available chunks of a certain order in which these
              zones are split. The size in bytes of a certain order
              is given by the formula:</p>

              <p>(2^order) * PAGE_SIZE</p>

              <p>The binary buddy allocator algorithm inside the
              kernel will split one chunk into two chunks of a
              smaller order (thus with half the size) or combine
              two contiguous chunks into one larger chunk of a
              higher order (thus with double the size) to satisfy
              allocation requests and to counter memory
              fragmentation. The order matches the column number,
              when starting to count at zero.</p>

              <p>For example on a x86_64 system:</p>

              <div class="informalexample">
                <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
Node 0, zone     DMA     1    1    1    0    2    1    1    0    1    1    3
Node 0, zone   DMA32    65   47    4   81   52   28   13   10    5    1  404
Node 0, zone  Normal   216   55  189  101   84   38   37   27    5    3  587
</pre>
              </div>

              <p>In this example, there is one node containing
              three zones and there are 11 different chunk sizes.
              If the page size is 4 kilobytes, then the first zone
              called <code class="constant">DMA</code> (on x86 the
              first 16 megabyte of memory) has 1 chunk of 4
              kilobytes (order 0) available and has 3 chunks of 4
              megabytes (order 10) available.</p>

              <p>If the memory is heavily fragmented, the counters
              for higher order chunks will be zero and allocation
              of large contiguous areas will fail.</p>

              <p>Further information about the zones can be found
              in <code class="filename">/proc/zoneinfo</code>.</p>

              <p>This (read-only) file contains three numbers: the
              number of allocated file handles (i.e., the number of
              files presently opened); the number of free file
              handles; and the maximum number of file handles
              (i.e., the same value as <code class="filename">/proc/sys/fs/file-max</code>). If the
              number of allocated file handles is close to the
              maximum, you should consider increasing the maximum.
              Before Linux 2.6, the kernel allocated file handles
              dynamically, but it didn't free them again. Instead
              the free file handles were kept in a list for
              reallocation; the "free file handles" value indicates
              the size of that list. A large number of free file
              handles indicates that there was a past peak in the
              usage of open file handles. Since Linux 2.6, the
              kernel does deallocate freed file handles, and the
              "free file handles" value is always zero.</p>

              <p>This writable file defines a percentage by which
              memory can be overcommitted. The default value in the

              <p>This enables or disables a kernel panic in an
              out-of-memory situation.</p>

              <p>If this file is set to the value 0, the kernel's
              OOM-killer will kill some rogue process. Usually, the
              OOM-killer is able to kill a rogue process and the
              system will survive.</p>

              <p>If this file is set to the value 1, then the
              kernel normally panics when out-of-memory happens.
              However, if a process limits allocations to certain
              nodes using memory policies (<a class="link" href="../htmlman2/mbind.2.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">mbind</span>(2)</span></a>
              <code class="constant">MPOL_BIND</code>) or cpusets

              those nodes reach memory exhaustion status, one
              process may be killed by the OOM-killer. No panic
              occurs in this case: because other nodes' memory may
              be free, this means the system as a whole may not
              have reached an out-of-memory situation yet.</p>

              <p>If this file is set to the value 2, the kernel
              always panics when an out-of-memory condition
              occurs.</p>

              <p>The default value is 0. 1 and 2 are for failover
              of clustering. Select either according to your policy
              of failover.</p>

              <p>This is a debugging facility to make timer (ab)use
              in a Linux system visible to kernel and user-space
              developers. It can be used by kernel and user-space
              developers to verify that their code does not make
              undue use of timers. The goal is to avoid unnecessary
              wakeups, thereby optimizing power consumption.</p>

              <p>If enabled in the kernel (<code class="constant">CONFIG_TIMER_STATS</code>), but not used,
              it has almost zero runtime overhead and a relatively
              small data-structure overhead. Even if collection is
              enabled at runtime, overhead is low: all the locking
              is per-CPU and lookup is hashed.</p>

              <p>The <code class="filename">/proc/timer_stats</code> file is used both
              to control sampling facility and to read out the
              sampled information.</p>

              <p>The timer_stats functionality is inactive on
              bootup. A sampling period can be started using the
              following command:</p>

              <p># echo 1 &gt; /proc/timer_stats</p>

              <p>The following command stops a sampling period:</p>

              <p># echo 0 &gt; /proc/timer_stats</p>

              <p>The statistics can be retrieved by:</p>

              <p>$ cat /proc/timer_stats</p>

              <p>While sampling is enabled, each readout from
              <code class="filename">/proc/timer_stats</code> will
              see newly updated statistics. Once sampling is
              disabled, the sampled information is kept until a new
              sample period is started. This allows multiple
              readouts.</p>
