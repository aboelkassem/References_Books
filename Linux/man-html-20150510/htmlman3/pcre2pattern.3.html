      <h2>PCRE2 REGULAR EXPRESSION DETAILS</h2>

      <p>The syntax and semantics of the regular expressions that
      are supported by PCRE2 are described in detail below. There
      is a quick-reference syntax summary in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2syntax.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2syntax</span>(3)</span></a> page. PCRE2
      tries to match Perl syntax and semantics as closely as it
      can. PCRE2 also supports some alternative regular expression
      syntax (which does not conflict with the Perl syntax) in
      order to provide some compatibility with regular expressions
      in Python, .NET, and Oniguruma.</p>

      <p>Perl's regular expressions are described in its own
      documentation, and regular expressions in general are covered
      in a number of books, some of which have copious examples.
      Jeffrey Friedl's "Mastering Regular Expressions", published
      by O'Reilly, covers regular expressions in great detail. This
      description of PCRE2's regular expressions is intended as
      reference material.</p>

      <p>This document discusses the patterns that are supported by
      PCRE2 when its main matching function, <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), is used. PCRE2 also has an
      alternative matching function, <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>(), which matches using a
      different algorithm that is not Perl-compatible. Some of the
      features discussed below are not available when DFA matching
      is used. The advantages and disadvantages of the alternative
      function, and how it differs from the normal function, are
      discussed in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2matching.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2matching</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

      <h2>SPECIAL START-OF-PATTERN ITEMS</h2>

      <p>A number of options that can be passed to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() can also be set by special
      items at the start of a pattern. These are not
      Perl-compatible, but are provided to make these options
      accessible to pattern writers who are not able to change the
      program that processes the pattern. Any number of these items
      may appear, but they must all be together right at the start
      of the pattern string, and the letters must be in upper
      case.</p>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect3" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>UTF support</h3>

        <p>In the 8-bit and 16-bit PCRE2 libraries, characters may
        be coded either as single code units, or as multiple UTF-8
        or UTF-16 code units. UTF-32 can be specified for the
        32-bit library, in which case it constrains the character
        values to valid Unicode code points. To process UTF
        strings, PCRE2 must be built to include Unicode support
        (which is the default). When using UTF strings you must
        either call the compiling function with the PCRE2_UTF
        option, or the pattern must start with the special sequence
        (*UTF), which is equivalent to setting the relevant option.
        How setting a UTF mode affects pattern matching is
        mentioned in several places below. There is also a summary
        of features in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2unicode.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2unicode</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

        <p>Some applications that allow their users to supply
        patterns may wish to restrict them to non-UTF data for
        security reasons. If the PCRE2_NEVER_UTF option is passed
        to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(), (*UTF) is
        not allowed, and its appearance in a pattern causes an
        error.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect4" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Unicode property support</h3>

        <p>Another special sequence that may appear at the start of
        a pattern is (*UCP). This has the same effect as setting
        the PCRE2_UCP option: it causes sequences such as \d and \w
        to use Unicode properties to determine character types,
        instead of recognizing only characters with codes less than
        128 via a lookup table.</p>

        <p>Some applications that allow their users to supply
        patterns may wish to restrict them for security reasons. If
        the PCRE2_NEVER_UCP option is passed to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(), (*UCP) is not allowed,
        and its appearance in a pattern causes an error.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect5" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Locking out empty string matching</h3>

        <p>Starting a pattern with (*NOTEMPTY) or
        (*NOTEMPTY_ATSTART) has the same effect as passing the
        PCRE2_NOTEMPTY or PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART option to
        whichever matching function is subsequently called to match
        the pattern. These options lock out the matching of empty
        strings, either entirely, or only at the start of the
        subject.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect6" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect6" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Disabling auto-possessification</h3>

        <p>If a pattern starts with (*NO_AUTO_POSSESS), it has the
        same effect as setting the PCRE2_NO_AUTO_POSSESS option.
        This stops PCRE2 from making quantifiers possessive when
        what follows cannot match the repeated item. For example,
        by default a+b is treated as a++b. For more details, see
        the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a>

        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect7" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect7" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Disabling start-up optimizations</h3>

        <p>If a pattern starts with (*NO_START_OPT), it has the
        same effect as setting the PCRE2_NO_START_OPTIMIZE option.
        This disables several optimizations for quickly reaching
        "no match" results. For more details, see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a>

        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect8" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect8" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Disabling automatic anchoring</h3>

        <p>If a pattern starts with (*NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR), it has
        the same effect as setting the PCRE2_NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR
        option. This disables optimizations that apply to patterns
        whose top-level branches all start with .* (match any
        number of arbitrary characters). For more details, see the
        <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation.</p>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect9" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Setting match and recursion limits</h3>

        <p>The caller of <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() can set a limit on the
        number of times the internal <code class="function">match</code>() function is called and on the
        maximum depth of recursive calls. These facilities are
        provided to catch runaway matches that are provoked by
        patterns with huge matching trees (a typical example is a
        pattern with nested unlimited repeats) and to avoid running
        out of system stack by too much recursion. When one of
        these limits is reached, <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() gives an error return. The
        limits can also be set by items at the start of the pattern
        of the form</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (*LIMIT_MATCH=d)
 (*LIMIT_RECURSION=d)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>where d is any number of decimal digits. However, the
        value of the setting must be less than the value set (or
        defaulted) by the caller of <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() for it to have any effect.
        In other words, the pattern writer can lower the limits set
        by the programmer, but not raise them. If there is more
        than one setting of one of these limits, the lower value is
        used.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect10" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect10" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Newline conventions</h3>

        <p>PCRE2 supports five different conventions for indicating
        line breaks in strings: a single CR (carriage return)
        character, a single LF (linefeed) character, the
        two-character sequence CRLF, any of the three preceding, or
        any Unicode newline sequence. The <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a> page has
        further discussion about newlines, and shows how to set the
        newline convention when calling <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>().</p>

        <p>It is also possible to specify a newline convention by
        starting a pattern string with one of the following five
        sequences:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (*CR)        carriage return
 (*LF)        linefeed
 (*CRLF)      carriage return, followed by linefeed
 (*ANYCRLF)   any of the three above
 (*ANY)       all Unicode newline sequences
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>These override the default and the options given to the
        compiling function. For example, on a Unix system where LF
        is the default newline sequence, the pattern</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*CR)a.b
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>changes the convention to CR. That pattern matches
        "a\nb" because LF is no longer a newline. If more than one
        of these settings is present, the last one is used.</p>

        <p>The newline convention affects where the circumflex and
        dollar assertions are true. It also affects the
        interpretation of the dot metacharacter when PCRE2_DOTALL
        is not set, and the behaviour of \N. However, it does not
        affect what the \R escape sequence matches. By default,
        this is any Unicode newline sequence, for Perl
        compatibility. However, this can be changed; see the
        description of \R in the section entitled "Newline
        sequences" below. A change of \R setting can be combined
        with a change of newline convention.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect11" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect11" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Specifying what \R matches</h3>

        <p>It is possible to restrict \R to match only CR, LF, or
        CRLF (instead of the complete set of Unicode line endings)
        by setting the option PCRE2_BSR_ANYCRLF at compile time.
        This effect can also be achieved by starting a pattern with
        (*BSR_ANYCRLF). For completeness, (*BSR_UNICODE) is also
        recognized, corresponding to PCRE2_BSR_UNICODE.</p>

      <h2>EBCDIC CHARACTER CODES</h2>

      <p>PCRE2 can be compiled to run in an environment that uses
      EBCDIC as its character code rather than ASCII or Unicode
      (typically a mainframe system). In the sections below,
      character code values are ASCII or Unicode; in an EBCDIC
      environment these characters may have different code values,
      and there are no code points greater than 255.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect13" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect13" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>CHARACTERS AND METACHARACTERS</h2>

      <p>A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against
      a subject string from left to right. Most characters stand
      for themselves in a pattern, and match the corresponding
      characters in the subject. As a trivial example, the
      pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
The quick brown fox
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches a portion of a subject string that is identical to
      itself. When caseless matching is specified (the
      PCRE2_CASELESS option), letters are matched independently of
      case.</p>

      <p>The power of regular expressions comes from the ability to
      include alternatives and repetitions in the pattern. These
      are encoded in the pattern by the use of <code class="function">metacharacters</code>, which do not stand for
      themselves but instead are interpreted in some special
      way.</p>

      <p>There are two different sets of metacharacters: those that
      are recognized anywhere in the pattern except within square
      brackets, and those that are recognized within square
      brackets. Outside square brackets, the metacharacters are as
      follows:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \      general escape character with several uses
 ^      assert start of string (or line, in multiline mode)
 $      assert end of string (or line, in multiline mode)
 .      match any character except newline (by default)
 [      start character class definition
 |      start of alternative branch
 (      start subpattern
 )      end subpattern
 ?      extends the meaning of (
        also 0 or 1 quantifier
        also quantifier minimizer
 *      0 or more quantifier
 +      1 or more quantifier
        also "possessive quantifier"
 {      start min/max quantifier
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Part of a pattern that is in square brackets is called a
      "character class". In a character class the only
      metacharacters are:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \      general escape character
 ^      negate the class, but only if the first character
 -      indicates character range
 [      POSIX character class (only if followed by POSIX
          syntax)
 ]      terminates the character class
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The following sections describe the use of each of the
      metacharacters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect14" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect14" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>BACKSLASH</h2>

      <p>The backslash character has several uses. Firstly, if it
      is followed by a character that is not a number or a letter,
      it takes away any special meaning that character may have.
      This use of backslash as an escape character applies both
      inside and outside character classes.</p>

      <p>For example, if you want to match a * character, you write
      \* in the pattern. This escaping action applies whether or
      not the following character would otherwise be interpreted as
      a metacharacter, so it is always safe to precede a
      non-alphanumeric with backslash to specify that it stands for
      itself. In particular, if you want to match a backslash, you
      write \\.</p>

      <p>In a UTF mode, only ASCII numbers and letters have any
      special meaning after a backslash. All other characters (in
      particular, those whose codepoints are greater than 127) are
      treated as literals.</p>

      <p>If a pattern is compiled with the PCRE2_EXTENDED option,
      most white space in the pattern (other than in a character
      class), and characters between a # outside a character class
      and the next newline, inclusive, are ignored. An escaping
      backslash can be used to include a white space or # character
      as part of the pattern.</p>

      <p>If you want to remove the special meaning from a sequence
      of characters, you can do so by putting them between \Q and
      \E. This is different from Perl in that $ and @ are handled
      as literals in \Q...\E sequences in PCRE2, whereas in Perl, $
      and @ cause variable interpolation. Note the following
      examples:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
Pattern            PCRE2 matches   Perl matches
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \Qabc$xyz\E        abc$xyz        abc followed by the
                                     contents of $xyz
 \Qabc\$xyz\E       abc\$xyz       abc\$xyz
 \Qabc\E\$\Qxyz\E   abc$xyz        abc$xyz
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The \Q...\E sequence is recognized both inside and outside
      character classes. An isolated \E that is not preceded by \Q
      is ignored. If \Q is not followed by \E later in the pattern,
      the literal interpretation continues to the end of the
      pattern (that is, \E is assumed at the end). If the isolated
      \Q is inside a character class, this causes an error, because
      the character class is not terminated.</p>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect15" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect15" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Non-printing characters</h3>

        <p>A second use of backslash provides a way of encoding
        non-printing characters in patterns in a visible manner.
        There is no restriction on the appearance of non-printing
        characters in a pattern, but when a pattern is being
        prepared by text editing, it is often easier to use one of
        the following escape sequences than the binary character it
        represents:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \a        alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
 \cx       "control-x", where x is any ASCII character
 \e        escape (hex 1B)
 \f        form feed (hex 0C)
 \n        linefeed (hex 0A)
 \r        carriage return (hex 0D)
 \t        tab (hex 09)
 \0dd      character with octal code 0dd
 \ddd      character with octal code ddd, or back reference
 \o{ddd..} character with octal code ddd..
 \xhh      character with hex code hh
 \x{hhh..} character with hex code hhh.. (default mode)
 \uhhhh    character with hex code hhhh (when PCRE2_ALT_BSUX is set)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The precise effect of \cx on ASCII characters is as
        follows: if x is a lower case letter, it is converted to
        upper case. Then bit 6 of the character (hex 40) is
        inverted. Thus \cA to \cZ become hex 01 to hex 1A (A is 41,
        Z is 5A), but \c{ becomes hex 3B ({ is 7B), and \c; becomes
        hex 7B (; is 3B). If the code unit following \c has a value
        greater than 127, a compile-time error occurs. This locks
        out non-ASCII characters in all modes.</p>

        <p>The \c facility was designed for use with ASCII
        characters, but with the extension to Unicode it is even
        less useful than it once was. It is, however, recognized
        when PCRE2 is compiled in EBCDIC mode, where data items are
        always bytes. In this mode, all values are valid after \c.
        If the next character is a lower case letter, it is
        converted to upper case. Then the 0xc0 bits of the byte are
        inverted. Thus \cA becomes hex 01, as in ASCII (A is C1),
        but because the EBCDIC letters are disjoint, \cZ becomes
        hex 29 (Z is E9), and other characters also generate
        different values.</p>

        <p>After \0 up to two further octal digits are read. If
        there are fewer than two digits, just those that are
        present are used. Thus the sequence \0\x\07 specifies two
        binary zeros followed by a BEL character (code value 7).
        Make sure you supply two digits after the initial zero if
        the pattern character that follows is itself an octal
        digit.</p>

        <p>The escape \o must be followed by a sequence of octal
        digits, enclosed in braces. An error occurs if this is not
        the case. This escape is a recent addition to Perl; it
        provides way of specifying character code points as octal
        numbers greater than 0777, and it also allows octal numbers
        and back references to be unambiguously specified.</p>

        <p>For greater clarity and unambiguity, it is best to avoid
        following \ by a digit greater than zero. Instead, use \o{}
        or \x{} to specify character numbers, and \g{} to specify
        back references. The following paragraphs describe the old,
        ambiguous syntax.</p>

        <p>The handling of a backslash followed by a digit other
        than 0 is complicated, and Perl has changed in recent
        releases, causing PCRE2 also to change. Outside a character
        class, PCRE2 reads the digit and any following digits as a
        decimal number. If the number is less than 8, or if there
        have been at least that many previous capturing left
        parentheses in the expression, the entire sequence is taken
        as a <span class="emphasis"><em>back reference</em></span>.
        A description of how this works is given later, following
        the discussion of parenthesized subpatterns.</p>

        <p>Inside a character class, or if the decimal number
        following \ is greater than 7 and there have not been that
        many capturing subpatterns, PCRE2 handles \8 and \9 as the
        literal characters "8" and "9", and otherwise re-reads up
        to three octal digits following the backslash, using them
        to generate a data character. Any subsequent digits stand
        for themselves. For example:</p>

        <p>\040 is another way of writing an ASCII space</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \40    is the same, provided there are fewer than 40
           previous capturing subpatterns
 \7     is always a back reference
 \11    might be a back reference, or another way of
           writing a tab
 \011   is always a tab
 \0113  is a tab followed by the character "3"
 \113   might be a back reference, otherwise the
           character with octal code 113
 \377   might be a back reference, otherwise
           the value 255 (decimal)
 \81    is either a back reference, or the two
           characters "8" and "1"
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Note that octal values of 100 or greater that are
        specified using this syntax must not be introduced by a
        leading zero, because no more than three octal digits are
        ever read.</p>

        <p>By default, after \x that is not followed by {, from
        zero to two hexadecimal digits are read (letters can be in
        upper or lower case). Any number of hexadecimal digits may
        appear between \x{ and }. If a character other than a
        hexadecimal digit appears between \x{ and }, or if there is
        no terminating }, an error occurs.</p>

        <p>If the PCRE2_ALT_BSUX option is set, the interpretation
        of \x is as just described only when it is followed by two
        hexadecimal digits. Otherwise, it matches a literal "x"
        character. In this mode mode, support for code points
        greater than 256 is provided by \u, which must be followed
        by four hexadecimal digits; otherwise it matches a literal
        "u" character.</p>

        <p>Characters whose value is less than 256 can be defined
        by either of the two syntaxes for \x (or by \u in
        PCRE2_ALT_BSUX mode). There is no difference in the way
        they are handled. For example, \xdc is exactly the same as
        \x{dc} (or \u00dc in PCRE2_ALT_BSUX mode).</p>

        <h3>Constraints on character values</h3>

        <p>Characters that are specified using octal or hexadecimal
        numbers are limited to certain values, as follows:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 8-bit non-UTF mode    less than 0x100
 8-bit UTF-8 mode      less than 0x10ffff and a valid codepoint
 16-bit non-UTF mode   less than 0x10000
 16-bit UTF-16 mode    less than 0x10ffff and a valid codepoint
 32-bit non-UTF mode   less than 0x100000000
 32-bit UTF-32 mode    less than 0x10ffff and a valid codepoint
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Invalid Unicode codepoints are the range 0xd800 to
        0xdfff (the so-called "surrogate" codepoints), and
        0xffef.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect17" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect17" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Escape sequences in character classes</h3>

        <p>All the sequences that define a single character value
        can be used both inside and outside character classes. In
        addition, inside a character class, \b is interpreted as
        the backspace character (hex 08).</p>

        <p>\N is not allowed in a character class. \B, \R, and \X
        are not special inside a character class. Like other
        unrecognized alphabetic escape sequences, they cause an
        error. Outside a character class, these sequences have
        different meanings.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect18" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect18" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Unsupported escape sequences</h3>

        <p>In Perl, the sequences \l, \L, \u, and \U are recognized
        by its string handler and used to modify the case of
        following characters. By default, PCRE2 does not support
        these escape sequences. However, if the PCRE2_ALT_BSUX
        option is set, \U matches a "U" character, and \u can be
        used to define a character by code point, as described in
        the previous section.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect19" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect19" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Absolute and relative back references</h3>

        <p>The sequence \g followed by an unsigned or a negative
        number, optionally enclosed in braces, is an absolute or
        relative back reference. A named back reference can be
        coded as \g{name}. Back references are discussed later,
        following the discussion of parenthesized subpatterns.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect20" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect20" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Absolute and relative subroutine calls</h3>

        <p>For compatibility with Oniguruma, the non-Perl syntax \g
        followed by a name or a number enclosed either in angle
        brackets or single quotes, is an alternative syntax for
        referencing a subpattern as a "subroutine". Details are
        discussed later. Note that \g{...} (Perl syntax) and
        \g&lt;...&gt; (Oniguruma syntax) are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> synonymous. The former is a
        back reference; the latter is a subroutine call.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect21" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect21" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Generic character types</h3>

        <p>Another use of backslash is for specifying generic
        character types:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \d     any decimal digit
 \D     any character that is not a decimal digit
 \h     any horizontal white space character
 \H     any character that is not a horizontal white space character
 \s     any white space character
 \S     any character that is not a white space character
 \v     any vertical white space character
 \V     any character that is not a vertical white space character
 \w     any "word" character
 \W     any "non-word" character
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>There is also the single sequence \N, which matches a
        non-newline character. This is the same as the "."
        metacharacter when PCRE2_DOTALL is not set. Perl also uses
        \N to match characters by name; PCRE2 does not support
        this.</p>

        <p>Each pair of lower and upper case escape sequences
        partitions the complete set of characters into two disjoint
        sets. Any given character matches one, and only one, of
        each pair. The sequences can appear both inside and outside
        character classes. They each match one character of the
        appropriate type. If the current matching point is at the
        end of the subject string, all of them fail, because there
        is no character to match.</p>

        <p>The default \s characters are HT (9), LF (10), VT (11),
        FF (12), CR (13), and space (32), which are defined as
        white space in the "C" locale. This list may vary if
        locale-specific matching is taking place. For example, in
        some locales the "non-breaking space" character (\xA0) is
        recognized as white space, and in others the VT character
        is not.</p>

        <p>A "word" character is an underscore or any character
        that is a letter or digit. By default, the definition of
        letters and digits is controlled by PCRE2's low-valued
        character tables, and may vary if locale-specific matching
        is taking place (see "Locale support" in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a> page). For
        example, in a French locale such as "fr_FR" in Unix-like
        systems, or "french" in Windows, some character codes
        greater than 127 are used for accented letters, and these
        are then matched by \w. The use of locales with Unicode is
        discouraged.</p>

        <p>By default, characters whose code points are greater
        than 127 never match \d, \s, or \w, and always match \D,
        \S, and \W, although this may vary for characters in the
        range 128-255 when locale-specific matching is happening.
        These escape sequences retain their original meanings from
        before Unicode support was available, mainly for efficiency
        reasons. If the PCRE2_UCP option is set, the behaviour is
        changed so that Unicode properties are used to determine
        character types, as follows:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \d  any character that matches \p{Nd} (decimal digit)
 \s  any character that matches \p{Z} or \h or \v
 \w  any character that matches \p{L} or \p{N}, plus underscore
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The upper case escapes match the inverse sets of
        characters. Note that \d matches only decimal digits,
        whereas \w matches any Unicode digit, as well as any
        Unicode letter, and underscore. Note also that PCRE2_UCP
        affects \b, and \B because they are defined in terms of \w
        and \W. Matching these sequences is noticeably slower when
        PCRE2_UCP is set.</p>

        <p>The sequences \h, \H, \v, and \V, in contrast to the
        other sequences, which match only ASCII characters by
        default, always match a specific list of code points,
        whether or not PCRE2_UCP is set. The horizontal space
        characters are:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 U+0009     Horizontal tab (HT)
 U+0020     Space
 U+00A0     Non-break space
 U+1680     Ogham space mark
 U+180E     Mongolian vowel separator
 U+2000     En quad
 U+2001     Em quad
 U+2002     En space
 U+2003     Em space
 U+2004     Three-per-em space
 U+2005     Four-per-em space
 U+2006     Six-per-em space
 U+2007     Figure space
 U+2008     Punctuation space
 U+2009     Thin space
 U+200A     Hair space
 U+202F     Narrow no-break space
 U+205F     Medium mathematical space
 U+3000     Ideographic space
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The vertical space characters are:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 U+000A     Linefeed (LF)
 U+000B     Vertical tab (VT)
 U+000C     Form feed (FF)
 U+000D     Carriage return (CR)
 U+0085     Next line (NEL)
 U+2028     Line separator
 U+2029     Paragraph separator
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>In 8-bit, non-UTF-8 mode, only the characters with code
        points less than 256 are relevant.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect22" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect22" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Newline sequences</h3>

        <p>Outside a character class, by default, the escape
        sequence \R matches any Unicode newline sequence. In 8-bit
        non-UTF-8 mode \R is equivalent to the following:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&gt;\r\n|\n|\x0b|\f|\r|\x85)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This is an example of an "atomic group", details of
        which are given below. This particular group matches either
        the two-character sequence CR followed by LF, or one of the
        single characters LF (linefeed, U+000A), VT (vertical tab,
        U+000B), FF (form feed, U+000C), CR (carriage return,
        U+000D), or NEL (next line, U+0085). The two-character
        sequence is treated as a single unit that cannot be
        split.</p>

        <p>In other modes, two additional characters whose
        codepoints are greater than 255 are added: LS (line
        separator, U+2028) and PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).
        Unicode support is not needed for these characters to be
        recognized.</p>

        <p>It is possible to restrict \R to match only CR, LF, or
        CRLF (instead of the complete set of Unicode line endings)
        by setting the option PCRE2_BSR_ANYCRLF at compile time.
        (BSR is an abbrevation for "backslash R".) This can be made
        the default when PCRE2 is built; if this is the case, the
        other behaviour can be requested via the PCRE2_BSR_UNICODE
        option. It is also possible to specify these settings by
        starting a pattern string with one of the following
        sequences:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (*BSR_ANYCRLF)   CR, LF, or CRLF only
 (*BSR_UNICODE)   any Unicode newline sequence
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>These override the default and the options given to the
        compiling function. Note that these special settings, which
        are not Perl-compatible, are recognized only at the very
        start of a pattern, and that they must be in upper case. If
        more than one of them is present, the last one is used.
        They can be combined with a change of newline convention;
        for example, a pattern can start with:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*ANY)(*BSR_ANYCRLF)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>They can also be combined with the (*UTF) or (*UCP)
        special sequences. Inside a character class, \R is treated
        as an unrecognized escape sequence, and causes an
        error.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect23" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect23" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Unicode character properties</h3>

        <p>When PCRE2 is built with Unicode support (the default),
        three additional escape sequences that match characters
        with specific properties are available. In 8-bit non-UTF-8
        mode, these sequences are of course limited to testing
        characters whose codepoints are less than 256, but they do
        work in this mode. The extra escape sequences are:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \p{<code class="function">xx</code>}   a character with the <code class="function">xx</code> property
 \P{<code class="function">xx</code>}   a character without the <code class="function">xx</code> property
 \X       a Unicode extended grapheme cluster
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The property names represented by <code class="function">xx</code> above are limited to the Unicode
        script names, the general category properties, "Any", which
        matches any character (including newline), and some special
        PCRE2 properties (described in the next section). Other
        Perl properties such as "InMusicalSymbols" are not
        supported by PCRE2. Note that \P{Any} does not match any
        characters, so always causes a match failure.</p>

        <p>Sets of Unicode characters are defined as belonging to
        certain scripts. A character from one of these sets can be
        matched using a script name. For example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \p{Greek}
 \P{Han}
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Those that are not part of an identified script are
        lumped together as "Common". The current list of scripts
        is:</p>

        <p>Arabic, Armenian, Avestan, Balinese, Bamum, Bassa_Vah,
        Batak, Bengali, Bopomofo, Brahmi, Braille, Buginese, Buhid,

        Tibetan, Tifinagh, Tirhuta, Ugaritic, Vai, Warang_Citi,
        Yi.</p>

        <p>Each character has exactly one Unicode general category
        property, specified by a two-letter abbreviation. For
        compatibility with Perl, negation can be specified by
        including a circumflex between the opening brace and the
        property name. For example, \p{^Lu} is the same as
        \P{Lu}.</p>

        <p>If only one letter is specified with \p or \P, it
        includes all the general category properties that start
        with that letter. In this case, in the absence of negation,
        the curly brackets in the escape sequence are optional;
        these two examples have the same effect:</p>

        <p>The special property L&amp; is also supported: it
        matches a character that has the Lu, Ll, or Lt property, in
        other words, a letter that is not classified as a modifier
        or "other".</p>

        <p>The Cs (Surrogate) property applies only to characters
        in the range U+D800 to U+DFFF. Such characters are not
        valid in Unicode strings and so cannot be tested by PCRE2,
        unless UTF validity checking has been turned off (see the
        discussion of PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a> page). Perl
        does not support the Cs property.</p>

        <p>The long synonyms for property names that Perl supports
        (such as \p{Letter}) are not supported by PCRE2, nor is it
        permitted to prefix any of these properties with "Is".</p>

        <p>No character that is in the Unicode table has the Cn
        (unassigned) property. Instead, this property is assumed
        for any code point that is not in the Unicode table.</p>

        <p>Specifying caseless matching does not affect these
        escape sequences. For example, \p{Lu} always matches only
        upper case letters. This is different from the behaviour of
        current versions of Perl.</p>

        <p>Matching characters by Unicode property is not fast,
        because PCRE2 has to do a multistage table lookup in order
        to find a character's property. That is why the traditional
        escape sequences such as \d and \w do not use Unicode
        properties in PCRE2 by default, though you can make them do
        so by setting the PCRE2_UCP option or by starting the
        pattern with (*UCP).</p>

        <h3>Extended grapheme clusters</h3>

        <p>The \X escape matches any number of Unicode characters
        that form an "extended grapheme cluster", and treats the
        sequence as an atomic group (see below). Unicode supports
        various kinds of composite character by giving each
        character a grapheme breaking property, and having rules
        that use these properties to define the boundaries of
        extended grapheme clusters. \X always matches at least one
        character. Then it decides whether to add additional
        characters according to the following rules for ending a
        cluster:</p>

        <p>1. End at the end of the subject string.</p>

        <p>2. Do not end between CR and LF; otherwise end after any
        control character.</p>

        <p>3. Do not break Hangul (a Korean script) syllable
        sequences. Hangul characters are of five types: L, V, T,
        LV, and LVT. An L character may be followed by an L, V, LV,
        or LVT character; an LV or V character may be followed by a
        V or T character; an LVT or T character may be follwed only
        by a T character.</p>

        <p>4. Do not end before extending characters or spacing
        marks. Characters with the "mark" property always have the
        "extend" grapheme breaking property.</p>

        <p>5. Do not end after prepend characters.</p>

        <p>6. Otherwise, end the cluster.</p>

        <h3>PCRE2's additional properties</h3>

        <p>As well as the standard Unicode properties described
        above, PCRE2 supports four more that make it possible to
        convert traditional escape sequences such as \w and \s to
        use Unicode properties. PCRE2 uses these non-standard,
        non-Perl properties internally when PCRE2_UCP is set.
        However, they may also be used explicitly. These properties
        are:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 Xan   Any alphanumeric character
 Xps   Any POSIX space character
 Xsp   Any Perl space character
 Xwd   Any Perl "word" character
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Xan matches characters that have either the L (letter)
        or the N (number) property. Xps matches the characters tab,
        linefeed, vertical tab, form feed, or carriage return, and
        any other character that has the Z (separator) property.
        Xsp is the same as Xps; in PCRE1 it used to exclude
        vertical tab, for Perl compatibility, but Perl changed. Xwd
        matches the same characters as Xan, plus underscore.</p>

        <p>There is another non-standard property, Xuc, which
        matches any character that can be represented by a
        Universal Character Name in C++ and other programming
        languages. These are the characters $, @, ` (grave accent),
        and all characters with Unicode code points greater than or
        equal to U+00A0, except for the surrogates U+D800 to
        U+DFFF. Note that most base (ASCII) characters are
        excluded. (Universal Character Names are of the form \uHHHH
        or \UHHHHHHHH where H is a hexadecimal digit. Note that the
        Xuc property does not match these sequences but the
        characters that they represent.)</p>
      </div>

        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect26" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect26" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Resetting the match start</h3>

        <p>The escape sequence \K causes any previously matched
        characters not to be included in the final matched
        sequence. For example, the pattern:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
foo\Kbar
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches "foobar", but reports that it has matched "bar".
        This feature is similar to a lookbehind assertion
        (described below). However, in this case, the part of the
        subject before the real match does not have to be of fixed
        length, as lookbehind assertions do. The use of \K does not
        interfere with the setting of captured substrings. For
        example, when the pattern</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(foo)\Kbar
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches "foobar", the first substring is still set to
        "foo".</p>

        <p>Perl documents that the use of \K within assertions is
        "not well defined". In PCRE2, \K is acted upon when it
        occurs inside positive assertions, but is ignored in
        negative assertions. Note that when a pattern such as
        (?=ab\K) matches, the reported start of the match can be
        greater than the end of the match.</p>

        <h3>Simple assertions</h3>

        <p>The final use of backslash is for certain simple
        assertions. An assertion specifies a condition that has to
        be met at a particular point in a match, without consuming
        any characters from the subject string. The use of
        subpatterns for more complicated assertions is described
        below. The backslashed assertions are:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 \b     matches at a word boundary
 \B     matches when not at a word boundary
 \A     matches at the start of the subject
 \Z     matches at the end of the subject
         also matches before a newline at the end of the subject
 \z     matches only at the end of the subject
 \G     matches at the first matching position in the subject
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Inside a character class, \b has a different meaning; it
        matches the backspace character. If any other of these
        assertions appears in a character class, an "invalid escape
        sequence" error is generated.</p>

        <p>A word boundary is a position in the subject string
        where the current character and the previous character do
        not both match \w or \W (i.e. one matches \w and the other
        matches \W), or the start or end of the string if the first
        or last character matches \w, respectively. In a UTF mode,
        the meanings of \w and \W can be changed by setting the
        PCRE2_UCP option. When this is done, it also affects \b and
        \B. Neither PCRE2 nor Perl has a separate "start of word"
        or "end of word" metasequence. However, whatever follows \b
        normally determines which it is. For example, the fragment
        \ba matches "a" at the start of a word.</p>

        <p>The \A, \Z, and \z assertions differ from the
        traditional circumflex and dollar (described in the next
        section) in that they only ever match at the very start and
        end of the subject string, whatever options are set. Thus,
        they are independent of multiline mode. These three
        assertions are not affected by the PCRE2_NOTBOL or
        PCRE2_NOTEOL options, which affect only the behaviour of
        the circumflex and dollar metacharacters. However, if the
        <code class="function">startoffset</code> argument of
        <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is non-zero,
        indicating that matching is to start at a point other than
        the beginning of the subject, \A can never match. The
        difference between \Z and \z is that \Z matches before a
        newline at the end of the string as well as at the very
        end, whereas \z matches only at the end.</p>

        <p>The \G assertion is true only when the current matching
        position is at the start point of the match, as specified
        by the <code class="function">startoffset</code> argument
        of <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(). It differs
        from \A when the value of <code class="function">startoffset</code> is non-zero. By calling
        <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() multiple times
        with appropriate arguments, you can mimic Perl's /g option,
        and it is in this kind of implementation where \G can be
        useful.</p>

        <p>Note, however, that PCRE2's interpretation of \G, as the
        start of the current match, is subtly different from
        Perl's, which defines it as the end of the previous match.
        In Perl, these can be different when the previously matched
        string was empty. Because PCRE2 does just one match at a
        time, it cannot reproduce this behaviour.</p>

        <p>If all the alternatives of a pattern begin with \G, the
        expression is anchored to the starting match position, and
        the "anchored" flag is set in the compiled regular
        expression.</p>

      <h2>CIRCUMFLEX AND DOLLAR</h2>

      <p>The circumflex and dollar metacharacters are zero-width
      assertions. That is, they test for a particular condition
      being true without consuming any characters from the subject
      string.</p>

      <p>Outside a character class, in the default matching mode,
      the circumflex character is an assertion that is true only if
      the current matching point is at the start of the subject
      string. If the <code class="function">startoffset</code>
      argument of <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is
      non-zero, circumflex can never match if the PCRE2_MULTILINE
      option is unset. Inside a character class, circumflex has an
      entirely different meaning (see below).</p>

      <p>Circumflex need not be the first character of the pattern
      if a number of alternatives are involved, but it should be
      the first thing in each alternative in which it appears if
      the pattern is ever to match that branch. If all possible
      alternatives start with a circumflex, that is, if the pattern
      is constrained to match only at the start of the subject, it
      is said to be an "anchored" pattern. (There are also other
      constructs that can cause a pattern to be anchored.)</p>

      <p>The dollar character is an assertion that is true only if
      the current matching point is at the end of the subject
      string, or immediately before a newline at the end of the
      string (by default). Note, however, that it does not actually
      match the newline. Dollar need not be the last character of
      the pattern if a number of alternatives are involved, but it
      should be the last item in any branch in which it appears.
      Dollar has no special meaning in a character class.</p>

      <p>The meaning of dollar can be changed so that it matches
      only at the very end of the string, by setting the
      PCRE2_DOLLAR_ENDONLY option at compile time. This does not
      affect the \Z assertion.</p>

      <p>The meanings of the circumflex and dollar characters are
      changed if the PCRE2_MULTILINE option is set. When this is
      the case, a circumflex matches immediately after internal
      newlines as well as at the start of the subject string. It
      does not match after a newline that ends the string. A dollar
      matches before any newlines in the string, as well as at the
      very end, when PCRE2_MULTILINE is set. When newline is
      specified as the two-character sequence CRLF, isolated CR and
      LF characters do not indicate newlines.</p>

      <p>For example, the pattern /^abc$/ matches the subject
      string "def\nabc" (where \n represents a newline) in
      multiline mode, but not otherwise. Consequently, patterns
      that are anchored in single line mode because all branches
      start with ^ are not anchored in multiline mode, and a match
      for circumflex is possible when the <code class="function">startoffset</code> argument of <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is non-zero. The
      PCRE2_DOLLAR_ENDONLY option is ignored if PCRE2_MULTILINE is
      set.</p>

      <p>Note that the sequences \A, \Z, and \z can be used to
      match the start and end of the subject in both modes, and if
      all branches of a pattern start with \A it is always
      anchored, whether or not PCRE2_MULTILINE is set.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect29" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect29" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>FULL STOP (PERIOD, DOT) AND \N</h2>

      <p>Outside a character class, a dot in the pattern matches
      any one character in the subject string except (by default) a
      character that signifies the end of a line.</p>

      <p>When a line ending is defined as a single character, dot
      never matches that character; when the two-character sequence
      CRLF is used, dot does not match CR if it is immediately
      followed by LF, but otherwise it matches all characters
      (including isolated CRs and LFs). When any Unicode line
      endings are being recognized, dot does not match CR or LF or
      any of the other line ending characters.</p>

      <p>The behaviour of dot with regard to newlines can be
      changed. If the PCRE2_DOTALL option is set, a dot matches any
      one character, without exception. If the two-character
      sequence CRLF is present in the subject string, it takes two
      dots to match it.</p>

      <p>The handling of dot is entirely independent of the
      handling of circumflex and dollar, the only relationship
      being that they both involve newlines. Dot has no special
      meaning in a character class.</p>

      <p>The escape sequence \N behaves like a dot, except that it
      is not affected by the PCRE2_DOTALL option. In other words,
      it matches any character except one that signifies the end of
      a line. Perl also uses \N to match characters by name; PCRE2
      does not support this.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect30" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect30" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>MATCHING A SINGLE CODE UNIT</h2>

      <p>Outside a character class, the escape sequence \C matches
      any one code unit, whether or not a UTF mode is set. In the
      8-bit library, one code unit is one byte; in the 16-bit
      library it is a 16-bit unit; in the 32-bit library it is a
      32-bit unit. Unlike a dot, \C always matches line-ending
      characters. The feature is provided in Perl in order to match
      individual bytes in UTF-8 mode, but it is unclear how it can
      usefully be used. Because \C breaks up characters into
      individual code units, matching one unit with \C in a UTF
      mode means that the rest of the string may start with a
      malformed UTF character. This has undefined results, because
      PCRE2 assumes that it is dealing with valid UTF strings (and
      by default it checks this at the start of processing unless
      the PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK option is used).</p>

      <p>PCRE2 does not allow \C to appear in lookbehind assertions
      (described below) in a UTF mode, because this would make it
      impossible to calculate the length of the lookbehind.</p>

      <p>In general, the \C escape sequence is best avoided.
      However, one way of using it that avoids the problem of
      malformed UTF characters is to use a lookahead to check the
      length of the next character, as in this pattern, which could
      be used with a UTF-8 string (ignore white space and line
      breaks):</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?| (?=[\x00-\x7f])(\C) |
     (?=[\x80-\x{7ff}])(\C)(\C) |
     (?=[\x{800}-\x{ffff}])(\C)(\C)(\C) |
     (?=[\x{10000}-\x{1fffff}])(\C)(\C)(\C)(\C))
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>In this example, a group that starts with (?| resets the
      capturing parentheses numbers in each alternative (see
      "Duplicate Subpattern Numbers" below). The assertions at the
      start of each branch check the next UTF-8 character for
      values whose encoding uses 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes, respectively.
      The character's individual bytes are then captured by the
      appropriate number of \C groups.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect31" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect31" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>SQUARE BRACKETS AND CHARACTER CLASSES</h2>

      <p>An opening square bracket introduces a character class,
      terminated by a closing square bracket. A closing square
      bracket on its own is not special by default. If a closing
      square bracket is required as a member of the class, it
      should be the first data character in the class (after an
      initial circumflex, if present) or escaped with a backslash.
      This means that, by default, an empty class cannot be
      defined. However, if the PCRE2_ALLOW_EMPTY_CLASS option is
      set, a closing square bracket at the start does end the
      (empty) class.</p>

      <p>A character class matches a single character in the
      subject. A matched character must be in the set of characters
      defined by the class, unless the first character in the class
      definition is a circumflex, in which case the subject
      character must not be in the set defined by the class. If a
      circumflex is actually required as a member of the class,
      ensure it is not the first character, or escape it with a
      backslash.</p>

      <p>For example, the character class [aeiou] matches any lower
      case vowel, while [^aeiou] matches any character that is not
      a lower case vowel. Note that a circumflex is just a
      convenient notation for specifying the characters that are in
      the class by enumerating those that are not. A class that
      starts with a circumflex is not an assertion; it still
      consumes a character from the subject string, and therefore
      it fails if the current pointer is at the end of the
      string.</p>

      <p>When caseless matching is set, any letters in a class
      represent both their upper case and lower case versions, so
      for example, a caseless [aeiou] matches "A" as well as "a",
      and a caseless [^aeiou] does not match "A", whereas a caseful
      version would.</p>

      <p>Characters that might indicate line breaks are never
      treated in any special way when matching character classes,
      whatever line-ending sequence is in use, and whatever setting
      of the PCRE2_DOTALL and PCRE2_MULTILINE options is used. A
      class such as [^a] always matches one of these
      characters.</p>

      <p>The minus (hyphen) character can be used to specify a
      range of characters in a character class. For example, [d-m]
      matches any letter between d and m, inclusive. If a minus
      character is required in a class, it must be escaped with a
      backslash or appear in a position where it cannot be
      interpreted as indicating a range, typically as the first or
      last character in the class, or immediately after a range.
      For example, [b-d-z] matches letters in the range b to d, a
      hyphen character, or z.</p>

      <p>It is not possible to have the literal character "]" as
      the end character of a range. A pattern such as [W-]46] is
      interpreted as a class of two characters ("W" and "-")
      followed by a literal string "46]", so it would match "W46]"
      or "-46]". However, if the "]" is escaped with a backslash it
      is interpreted as the end of range, so [W-\]46] is
      interpreted as a class containing a range followed by two
      other characters. The octal or hexadecimal representation of
      "]" can also be used to end a range.</p>

      <p>An error is generated if a POSIX character class (see
      below) or an escape sequence other than one that defines a
      single character appears at a point where a range ending
      character is expected. For example, [z-\xff] is valid, but
      [A-\d] and [A-[:digit:]] are not.</p>

      <p>Ranges operate in the collating sequence of character
      values. They can also be used for characters specified
      numerically, for example [\000-\037]. Ranges can include any
      characters that are valid for the current mode.</p>

      <p>If a range that includes letters is used when caseless
      matching is set, it matches the letters in either case. For
      example, [W-c] is equivalent to [][\\^_`wxyzabc], matched
      caselessly, and in a non-UTF mode, if character tables for a
      French locale are in use, [\xc8-\xcb] matches accented E
      characters in both cases.</p>

      <p>The character escape sequences \d, \D, \h, \H, \p, \P, \s,
      \S, \v, \V, \w, and \W may appear in a character class, and
      add the characters that they match to the class. For example,
      [\dABCDEF] matches any hexadecimal digit. In UTF modes, the
      PCRE2_UCP option affects the meanings of \d, \s, \w and their
      upper case partners, just as it does when they appear outside
      a character class, as described in the section entitled
      "Generic character types" above. The escape sequence \b has a
      different meaning inside a character class; it matches the
      backspace character. The sequences \B, \N, \R, and \X are not
      special inside a character class. Like any other unrecognized
      escape sequences, they cause an error.</p>

      <p>A circumflex can conveniently be used with the upper case
      character types to specify a more restricted set of
      characters than the matching lower case type. For example,
      the class [^\W_] matches any letter or digit, but not
      underscore, whereas [\w] includes underscore. A positive
      character class should be read as "something OR something OR
      ..." and a negative class as "NOT something AND NOT something
      AND NOT ...".</p>

      <p>The only metacharacters that are recognized in character
      classes are backslash, hyphen (only where it can be
      interpreted as specifying a range), circumflex (only at the
      start), opening square bracket (only when it can be
      interpreted as introducing a POSIX class name, or for a
      special compatibility feature - see the next two sections),
      and the terminating closing square bracket. However, escaping
      other non-alphanumeric characters does no harm.</p>

      <h2>POSIX CHARACTER CLASSES</h2>

      <p>Perl supports the POSIX notation for character classes.
      This uses names enclosed by [: and :] within the enclosing
      square brackets. PCRE2 also supports this notation. For
      example,</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
[01[:alpha:]%]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "0", "1", any alphabetic character, or "%". The
      supported class names are:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 alnum    letters and digits
 alpha    letters
 ascii    character codes 0 - 127
 blank    space or tab only
 cntrl    control characters
 digit    decimal digits (same as \d)
 graph    printing characters, excluding space
 lower    lower case letters
 print    printing characters, including space
 punct    printing characters, excluding letters and digits and space
 space    white space (the same as \s from PCRE2 8.34)
 upper    upper case letters
 word     "word" characters (same as \w)
 xdigit   hexadecimal digits
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The default "space" characters are HT (9), LF (10), VT
      (11), FF (12), CR (13), and space (32). If locale-specific
      matching is taking place, the list of space characters may be
      different; there may be fewer or more of them. "Space" and \s
      match the same set of characters.</p>

      <p>The name "word" is a Perl extension, and "blank" is a GNU
      extension from Perl 5.8. Another Perl extension is negation,
      which is indicated by a ^ character after the colon. For
      example,</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
[12[:^digit:]]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "1", "2", or any non-digit. PCRE2 (and Perl) also
      recognize the POSIX syntax [.ch.] and [=ch=] where "ch" is a
      "collating element", but these are not supported, and an
      error is given if they are encountered.</p>

      <p>By default, characters with values greater than 128 do not
      match any of the POSIX character classes. However, if the
      PCRE2_UCP option is passed to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(), some of the classes are
      changed so that Unicode character properties are used. This
      is achieved by replacing certain POSIX classes by other
      sequences, as follows:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 [:alnum:]  becomes  \p{Xan}
 [:alpha:]  becomes  \p{L}
 [:blank:]  becomes  \h
 [:cntrl:]  becomes  \p{Cc}
 [:digit:]  becomes  \p{Nd}
 [:lower:]  becomes  \p{Ll}
 [:space:]  becomes  \p{Xps}
 [:upper:]  becomes  \p{Lu}
 [:word:]   becomes  \p{Xwd}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Negated versions, such as [:^alpha:] use \P instead of \p.
      Three other POSIX classes are handled specially in UCP
      mode:</p>

      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl class="variablelist">
          <dt><span class="term">[:graph:]</span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>This matches characters that have glyphs that mark
            the page when printed. In Unicode property terms, it
            matches all characters with the L, M, N, P, S, or Cf
            properties, except for:</p>

            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 U+061C           Arabic Letter Mark
 U+180E           Mongolian Vowel Separator
 U+2066 - U+2069  Various "isolate"s
</pre>
            </div>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term">[:print:]</span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>This matches the same characters as [:graph:] plus
            space characters that are not controls, that is,
            characters with the Zs property.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><span class="term">[:punct:]</span></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>This matches all characters that have the Unicode P
            (punctuation) property, plus those characters with code
            points less than 128 that have the S (Symbol)
            property.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>

      <p>The other POSIX classes are unchanged, and match only
      characters with code points less than 128.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">

      <h2>COMPATIBILITY FEATURE FOR WORD BOUNDARIES</h2>

      <p>In the POSIX.2 compliant library that was included in
      4.4BSD Unix, the ugly syntax [[:&lt;:]] and [[:&gt;:]] is
      used for matching "start of word" and "end of word". PCRE2
      treats these items as follows:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 [[:&lt;:]]  is converted to  \b(?=\w)
 [[:&gt;:]]  is converted to  \b(?&lt;=\w)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Only these exact character sequences are recognized. A
      sequence such as [a[:&lt;:]b] provokes error for an
      unrecognized POSIX class name. This support is not compatible
      with Perl. It is provided to help migrations from other
      environments, and is best not used in any new patterns. Note
      that \b matches at the start and the end of a word (see
      "Simple assertions" above), and in a Perl-style pattern the
      preceding or following character normally shows which is
      wanted, without the need for the assertions that are used
      above in order to give exactly the POSIX behaviour.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect34" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect34" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>VERTICAL BAR</h2>

      <p>Vertical bar characters are used to separate alternative
      patterns. For example, the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
gilbert|sullivan
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches either "gilbert" or "sullivan". Any number of
      alternatives may appear, and an empty alternative is
      permitted (matching the empty string). The matching process
      tries each alternative in turn, from left to right, and the
      first one that succeeds is used. If the alternatives are
      within a subpattern (defined below), "succeeds" means
      matching the rest of the main pattern as well as the
      alternative in the subpattern.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect35" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect35" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>INTERNAL OPTION SETTING</h2>

      <p>The settings of the PCRE2_CASELESS, PCRE2_MULTILINE,
      PCRE2_DOTALL, and PCRE2_EXTENDED options (which are
      Perl-compatible) can be changed from within the pattern by a
      sequence of Perl option letters enclosed between "(?" and
      ")". The option letters are</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 i  for PCRE2_CASELESS
 m  for PCRE2_MULTILINE
 s  for PCRE2_DOTALL
 x  for PCRE2_EXTENDED
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>For example, (?im) sets caseless, multiline matching. It
      is also possible to unset these options by preceding the
      letter with a hyphen, and a combined setting and unsetting
      such as (?im-sx), which sets PCRE2_CASELESS and
      PCRE2_MULTILINE while unsetting PCRE2_DOTALL and
      PCRE2_EXTENDED, is also permitted. If a letter appears both
      before and after the hyphen, the option is unset.</p>

      <p>The PCRE2-specific options PCRE2_DUPNAMES and
      PCRE2_UNGREEDY can be changed in the same way as the
      Perl-compatible options by using the characters J and U
      respectively.</p>

      <p>When one of these option changes occurs at top level (that
      is, not inside subpattern parentheses), the change applies to
      the remainder of the pattern that follows. If the change is
      placed right at the start of a pattern, PCRE2 extracts it
      into the global options (and it will therefore show up in
      data extracted by the <code class="function">pcre2_pattern_info</code>() function).</p>

      <p>An option change within a subpattern (see below for a
      description of subpatterns) affects only that part of the
      subpattern that follows it, so</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a(?i)b)c
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches abc and aBc and no other strings (assuming
      PCRE2_CASELESS is not used). By this means, options can be
      made to have different settings in different parts of the
      pattern. Any changes made in one alternative do carry on into
      subsequent branches within the same subpattern. For
      example,</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a(?i)b|c)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "ab", "aB", "c", and "C", even though when
      matching "C" the first branch is abandoned before the option
      setting. This is because the effects of option settings
      happen at compile time. There would be some very weird
      behaviour otherwise.</p>

              sequences such as (*CRLF) to override what the
              application has set or what has been defaulted.
              Details are given in the section entitled "Newline
              sequences" above. There are also the (*UTF) and
              (*UCP) leading sequences that can be used to set UTF
              and Unicode property modes; they are equivalent to
              setting the PCRE2_UTF and PCRE2_UCP options,
              respectively. However, the application can set the
              PCRE2_NEVER_UTF and PCRE2_NEVER_UCP options, which
              lock out the use of the (*UTF) and (*UCP)
              sequences.</p>

      <h2>SUBPATTERNS</h2>

      <p>Subpatterns are delimited by parentheses (round brackets),
      which can be nested. Turning part of a pattern into a
      subpattern does two things:</p>

      <p>1. It localizes a set of alternatives. For example, the
      pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
cat(aract|erpillar|)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "cataract", "caterpillar", or "cat". Without the
      parentheses, it would match "cataract", "erpillar" or an
      empty string.</p>

      <p>2. It sets up the subpattern as a capturing subpattern.
      This means that, when the whole pattern matches, the portion
      of the subject string that matched the subpattern is passed
      back to the caller, separately from the portion that matched
      the whole pattern. (This applies only to the traditional
      matching function; the DFA matching function does not support
      capturing.)</p>

      <p>Opening parentheses are counted from left to right
      (starting from 1) to obtain numbers for the capturing
      subpatterns. For example, if the string "the red king" is
      matched against the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
the ((red|white) (king|queen))
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>the captured substrings are "red king", "red", and "king",
      and are numbered 1, 2, and 3, respectively.</p>

      <p>The fact that plain parentheses fulfil two functions is
      not always helpful. There are often times when a grouping
      subpattern is required without a capturing requirement. If an
      opening parenthesis is followed by a question mark and a
      colon, the subpattern does not do any capturing, and is not
      counted when computing the number of any subsequent capturing
      subpatterns. For example, if the string "the white queen" is
      matched against the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
the ((?:red|white) (king|queen))
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>the captured substrings are "white queen" and "queen", and
      are numbered 1 and 2. The maximum number of capturing
      subpatterns is 65535.</p>

      <p>As a convenient shorthand, if any option settings are
      required at the start of a non-capturing subpattern, the
      option letters may appear between the "?" and the ":". Thus
      the two patterns</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?i:saturday|sunday)
 (?:(?i)saturday|sunday)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>match exactly the same set of strings. Because alternative
      branches are tried from left to right, and options are not
      reset until the end of the subpattern is reached, an option
      setting in one branch does affect subsequent branches, so the
      above patterns match "SUNDAY" as well as "Saturday".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect37" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect37" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>DUPLICATE SUBPATTERN NUMBERS</h2>

      <p>Perl 5.10 introduced a feature whereby each alternative in
      a subpattern uses the same numbers for its capturing
      parentheses. Such a subpattern starts with (?| and is itself
      a non-capturing subpattern. For example, consider this
      pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?|(Sat)ur|(Sun))day
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Because the two alternatives are inside a (?| group, both
      sets of capturing parentheses are numbered one. Thus, when
      the pattern matches, you can look at captured substring
      number one, whichever alternative matched. This construct is
      useful when you want to capture part, but not all, of one of
      a number of alternatives. Inside a (?| group, parentheses are
      numbered as usual, but the number is reset at the start of
      each branch. The numbers of any capturing parentheses that
      follow the subpattern start after the highest number used in
      any branch. The following example is taken from the Perl
      documentation. The numbers underneath show in which buffer
      the captured content will be stored.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 # before  ---------------branch-reset----------- after
 / ( a )  (?| x ( y ) z | (p (q) r) | (t) u (v) ) ( z ) /x
 # 1            2         2  3        2     3     4
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>A back reference to a numbered subpattern uses the most
      recent value that is set for that number by any subpattern.
      The following pattern matches "abcabc" or "defdef":</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/(?|(abc)|(def))\1/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>In contrast, a subroutine call to a numbered subpattern
      always refers to the first one in the pattern with the given
      number. The following pattern matches "abcabc" or
      "defabc":</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/(?|(abc)|(def))(?1)/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If a condition test for a subpattern's having matched
      refers to a non-unique number, the test is true if any of the
      subpatterns of that number have matched.</p>

      <p>An alternative approach to using this "branch reset"
      feature is to use duplicate named subpatterns, as described
      in the next section.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect38" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect38" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>NAMED SUBPATTERNS</h2>

      <p>Identifying capturing parentheses by number is simple, but
      it can be very hard to keep track of the numbers in
      complicated regular expressions. Furthermore, if an
      expression is modified, the numbers may change. To help with
      this difficulty, PCRE2 supports the naming of subpatterns.
      This feature was not added to Perl until release 5.10. Python
      had the feature earlier, and PCRE1 introduced it at release
      4.0, using the Python syntax. PCRE2 supports both the Perl
      and the Python syntax. Perl allows identically numbered
      subpatterns to have different names, but PCRE2 does not.</p>

      <p>In PCRE2, a subpattern can be named in one of three ways:
      (?&lt;name&gt;...) or (?'name'...) as in Perl, or
      (?P&lt;name&gt;...) as in Python. References to capturing
      parentheses from other parts of the pattern, such as back
      references, recursion, and conditions, can be made by name as
      well as by number.</p>

      <p>Names consist of up to 32 alphanumeric characters and
      underscores, but must start with a non-digit. Named capturing
      parentheses are still allocated numbers as well as names,
      exactly as if the names were not present. The PCRE2 API
      provides function calls for extracting the name-to-number
      translation table from a compiled pattern. There are also
      convenience functions for extracting a captured substring by
      name.</p>

      <p>By default, a name must be unique within a pattern, but it
      is possible to relax this constraint by setting the
      PCRE2_DUPNAMES option at compile time. (Duplicate names are
      also always permitted for subpatterns with the same number,
      set up as described in the previous section.) Duplicate names
      can be useful for patterns where only one instance of the
      named parentheses can match. Suppose you want to match the
      name of a weekday, either as a 3-letter abbreviation or as
      the full name, and in both cases you want to extract the
      abbreviation. This pattern (ignoring the line breaks) does
      the job:</p>

      <p>There are five capturing substrings, but only one is ever
      set after a match. (An alternative way of solving this
      problem is to use a "branch reset" subpattern, as described
      in the previous section.)</p>

      <p>The convenience functions for extracting the data by name
      returns the substring for the first (and in this example, the
      only) subpattern of that name that matched. This saves
      searching to find which numbered subpattern it was.</p>

      <p>If you make a back reference to a non-unique named
      subpattern from elsewhere in the pattern, the subpatterns to
      which the name refers are checked in the order in which they
      appear in the overall pattern. The first one that is set is
      used for the reference. For example, this pattern matches
      both "foofoo" and "barbar" but not "foobar" or "barfoo":</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?:(?&lt;n&gt;foo)|(?&lt;n&gt;bar))\k&lt;n&gt;
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If you make a subroutine call to a non-unique named
      subpattern, the one that corresponds to the first occurrence
      of the name is used. In the absence of duplicate numbers (see
      the previous section) this is the one with the lowest
      number.</p>

      <p>If you use a named reference in a condition test (see the
      section about conditions below), either to check whether a
      subpattern has matched, or to check for recursion, all
      subpatterns with the same name are tested. If the condition
      is true for any one of them, the overall condition is true.
      This is the same behaviour as testing by number. For further
      details of the interfaces for handling named subpatterns, see

      <h2>REPETITION</h2>

      <p>Repetition is specified by quantifiers, which can follow
      any of the following items:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 a literal data character
 the dot metacharacter
 the \C escape sequence
 the \X escape sequence
 the \R escape sequence
 an escape such as \d or \pL that matches a single character
 a character class
 a back reference (see next section)
 a parenthesized subpattern (including assertions)
 a subroutine call to a subpattern (recursive or otherwise)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The general repetition quantifier specifies a minimum and
      maximum number of permitted matches, by giving the two
      numbers in curly brackets (braces), separated by a comma. The
      numbers must be less than 65536, and the first must be less
      than or equal to the second. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
z{2,4}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "zz", "zzz", or "zzzz". A closing brace on its own
      is not a special character. If the second number is omitted,
      but the comma is present, there is no upper limit; if the
      second number and the comma are both omitted, the quantifier
      specifies an exact number of required matches. Thus</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
[aeiou]{3,}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches at least 3 successive vowels, but may match many
      more, whereas</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\d{8}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches exactly 8 digits. An opening curly bracket that
      appears in a position where a quantifier is not allowed, or
      one that does not match the syntax of a quantifier, is taken
      as a literal character. For example, {,6} is not a
      quantifier, but a literal string of four characters.</p>

      <p>In UTF modes, quantifiers apply to characters rather than
      to individual code units. Thus, for example, \x{100}{2}
      matches two characters, each of which is represented by a
      two-byte sequence in a UTF-8 string. Similarly, \X{3} matches
      three Unicode extended grapheme clusters, each of which may
      be several code units long (and they may be of different
      lengths).</p>

      <p>The quantifier {0} is permitted, causing the expression to
      behave as if the previous item and the quantifier were not
      present. This may be useful for subpatterns that are
      referenced as subroutines from elsewhere in the pattern (but
      see also the section entitled "Defining subpatterns for use
      by reference only" below). Items other than subpatterns that
      have a {0} quantifier are omitted from the compiled
      pattern.</p>

      <p>For convenience, the three most common quantifiers have
      single-character abbreviations:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 *    is equivalent to {0,}
 +    is equivalent to {1,}
 ?    is equivalent to {0,1}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>It is possible to construct infinite loops by following a
      subpattern that can match no characters with a quantifier
      that has no upper limit, for example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a?)*
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Earlier versions of Perl and PCRE1 used to give an error
      at compile time for such patterns. However, because there are
      cases where this can be useful, such patterns are now
      accepted, but if any repetition of the subpattern does in
      fact match no characters, the loop is forcibly broken.</p>

      <p>By default, the quantifiers are "greedy", that is, they
      match as much as possible (up to the maximum number of
      permitted times), without causing the rest of the pattern to
      fail. The classic example of where this gives problems is in
      trying to match comments in C programs. These appear between
      /* and */ and within the comment, individual * and /
      characters may appear. An attempt to match C comments by
      applying the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/\*.*\*/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>to the string</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/* first comment */  not comment  /* second comment */
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>fails, because it matches the entire string owing to the
      greediness of the .* item.</p>

      <p>If a quantifier is followed by a question mark, it ceases
      to be greedy, and instead matches the minimum number of times
      possible, so the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/\*.*?\*/
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>does the right thing with the C comments. The meaning of
      the various quantifiers is not otherwise changed, just the
      preferred number of matches. Do not confuse this use of
      question mark with its use as a quantifier in its own right.
      Because it has two uses, it can sometimes appear doubled, as
      in</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\d??\d
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>which matches one digit by preference, but can match two
      if that is the only way the rest of the pattern matches.</p>

      <p>If the PCRE2_UNGREEDY option is set (an option that is not
      available in Perl), the quantifiers are not greedy by
      default, but individual ones can be made greedy by following
      them with a question mark. In other words, it inverts the
      default behaviour.</p>

      <p>When a parenthesized subpattern is quantified with a
      minimum repeat count that is greater than 1 or with a limited
      maximum, more memory is required for the compiled pattern, in
      proportion to the size of the minimum or maximum.</p>

      <p>If a pattern starts with .* or .{0,} and the PCRE2_DOTALL
      option (equivalent to Perl's /s) is set, thus allowing the
      dot to match newlines, the pattern is implicitly anchored,
      because whatever follows will be tried against every
      character position in the subject string, so there is no
      point in retrying the overall match at any position after the
      first. PCRE2 normally treats such a pattern as though it were
      preceded by \A.</p>

      <p>In cases where it is known that the subject string
      contains no newlines, it is worth setting PCRE2_DOTALL in
      order to obtain this optimization, or alternatively, using ^
      to indicate anchoring explicitly.</p>

      <p>However, there are some cases where the optimization
      cannot be used. When .* is inside capturing parentheses that
      are the subject of a back reference elsewhere in the pattern,
      a match at the start may fail where a later one succeeds.
      Consider, for example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(.*)abc\1
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the subject is "xyz123abc123" the match point is the
      fourth character. For this reason, such a pattern is not
      implicitly anchored.</p>

      <p>Another case where implicit anchoring is not applied is
      when the leading .* is inside an atomic group. Once again, a
      match at the start may fail where a later one succeeds.
      Consider this pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&gt;.*?a)b
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>It matches "ab" in the subject "aab". The use of the
      backtracking control verbs (*PRUNE) and (*SKIP) also disable
      this optimization, and there is an option,
      PCRE2_NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR, to do so explicitly.</p>

      <p>When a capturing subpattern is repeated, the value
      captured is the substring that matched the final iteration.
      For example, after</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(tweedle[dume]{3}\s*)+
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>has matched "tweedledum tweedledee" the value of the
      captured substring is "tweedledee". However, if there are
      nested capturing subpatterns, the corresponding captured
      values may have been set in previous iterations. For example,
      after</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a|(b))+
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "aba" the value of the second captured substring
      is "b".</p>
    </div>

      <h2>ATOMIC GROUPING AND POSSESSIVE QUANTIFIERS</h2>

      <p>With both maximizing ("greedy") and minimizing ("ungreedy"
      or "lazy") repetition, failure of what follows normally
      causes the repeated item to be re-evaluated to see if a
      different number of repeats allows the rest of the pattern to
      match. Sometimes it is useful to prevent this, either to
      change the nature of the match, or to cause it fail earlier
      than it otherwise might, when the author of the pattern knows
      there is no point in carrying on.</p>

      <p>Consider, for example, the pattern \d+foo when applied to
      the subject line</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
123456bar
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>After matching all 6 digits and then failing to match
      "foo", the normal action of the matcher is to try again with
      only 5 digits matching the \d+ item, and then with 4, and so
      on, before ultimately failing. "Atomic grouping" (a term
      taken from Jeffrey Friedl's book) provides the means for
      specifying that once a subpattern has matched, it is not to
      be re-evaluated in this way.</p>

      <p>If we use atomic grouping for the previous example, the
      matcher gives up immediately on failing to match "foo" the
      first time. The notation is a kind of special parenthesis,
      starting with (?&gt; as in this example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&gt;\d+)foo
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This kind of parenthesis "locks up" the part of the
      pattern it contains once it has matched, and a failure
      further into the pattern is prevented from backtracking into
      it. Backtracking past it to previous items, however, works as
      normal.</p>

      <p>An alternative description is that a subpattern of this
      type matches exactly the string of characters that an
      identical standalone pattern would match, if anchored at the
      current point in the subject string.</p>

      <p>Atomic grouping subpatterns are not capturing subpatterns.
      Simple cases such as the above example can be thought of as a
      maximizing repeat that must swallow everything it can. So,
      while both \d+ and \d+? are prepared to adjust the number of
      digits they match in order to make the rest of the pattern
      match, (?&gt;\d+) can only match an entire sequence of
      digits.</p>

      <p>Atomic groups in general can of course contain arbitrarily
      complicated subpatterns, and can be nested. However, when the
      subpattern for an atomic group is just a single repeated
      item, as in the example above, a simpler notation, called a
      "possessive quantifier" can be used. This consists of an
      additional + character following a quantifier. Using this
      notation, the previous example can be rewritten as</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\d++foo
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Note that a possessive quantifier can be used with an
      entire group, for example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc|xyz){2,3}+
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Possessive quantifiers are always greedy; the setting of
      the PCRE2_UNGREEDY option is ignored. They are a convenient
      notation for the simpler forms of atomic group. However,
      there is no difference in the meaning of a possessive
      quantifier and the equivalent atomic group, though there may
      be a performance difference; possessive quantifiers should be
      slightly faster.</p>

      <p>The possessive quantifier syntax is an extension to the
      Perl 5.8 syntax. Jeffrey Friedl originated the idea (and the
      name) in the first edition of his book. Mike McCloskey liked
      it, so implemented it when he built Sun's Java package, and
      PCRE1 copied it from there. It ultimately found its way into
      Perl at release 5.10.</p>

      <p>PCRE2 has an optimization that automatically
      "possessifies" certain simple pattern constructs. For
      example, the sequence A+B is treated as A++B because there is
      no point in backtracking into a sequence of A's when B must
      follow. This feature can be disabled by the
      PCRE2_NO_AUTOPOSSESS option, or starting the pattern with
      (*NO_AUTO_POSSESS).</p>

      <p>When a pattern contains an unlimited repeat inside a
      subpattern that can itself be repeated an unlimited number of
      times, the use of an atomic group is the only way to avoid
      some failing matches taking a very long time indeed. The
      pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(\D+|&lt;\d+&gt;)*[!?]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches an unlimited number of substrings that either
      consist of non-digits, or digits enclosed in &lt;&gt;,
      followed by either ! or ?. When it matches, it runs quickly.
      However, if it is applied to</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>it takes a long time before reporting failure. This is
      because the string can be divided between the internal \D+
      repeat and the external * repeat in a large number of ways,
      and all have to be tried. (The example uses [!?] rather than
      a single character at the end, because both PCRE2 and Perl
      have an optimization that allows for fast failure when a
      single character is used. They remember the last single
      character that is required for a match, and fail early if it
      is not present in the string.) If the pattern is changed so
      that it uses an atomic group, like this:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
((?&gt;\D+)|&lt;\d+&gt;)*[!?]
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>sequences of non-digits cannot be broken, and failure
      happens quickly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect41" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect41" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>BACK REFERENCES</h2>

      <p>Outside a character class, a backslash followed by a digit
      greater than 0 (and possibly further digits) is a back
      reference to a capturing subpattern earlier (that is, to its
      left) in the pattern, provided there have been that many
      previous capturing left parentheses.</p>

      <p>However, if the decimal number following the backslash is
      less than 8, it is always taken as a back reference, and
      causes an error only if there are not that many capturing
      left parentheses in the entire pattern. In other words, the
      parentheses that are referenced need not be to the left of
      the reference for numbers less than 8. A "forward back
      reference" of this type can make sense when a repetition is
      involved and the subpattern to the right has participated in
      an earlier iteration.</p>

      <p>It is not possible to have a numerical "forward back
      reference" to a subpattern whose number is 8 or more using
      this syntax because a sequence such as \50 is interpreted as
      a character defined in octal. See the subsection entitled
      "Non-printing characters" above for further details of the
      handling of digits following a backslash. There is no such
      problem when named parentheses are used. A back reference to
      any subpattern is possible using named parentheses (see
      below).</p>

      <p>Another way of avoiding the ambiguity inherent in the use
      of digits following a backslash is to use the \g escape
      sequence. This escape must be followed by an unsigned number
      or a negative number, optionally enclosed in braces. These
      examples are all identical:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (ring), \1
 (ring), \g1
 (ring), \g{1}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>An unsigned number specifies an absolute reference without
      the ambiguity that is present in the older syntax. It is also
      useful when literal digits follow the reference. A negative
      number is a relative reference. Consider this example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc(def)ghi)\g{-1}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The sequence \g{-1} is a reference to the most recently
      started capturing subpattern before \g, that is, is it
      equivalent to \2 in this example. Similarly, \g{-2} would be
      equivalent to \1. The use of relative references can be
      helpful in long patterns, and also in patterns that are
      created by joining together fragments that contain references
      within themselves.</p>

      <p>A back reference matches whatever actually matched the
      capturing subpattern in the current subject string, rather
      than anything matching the subpattern itself (see
      "Subpatterns as subroutines" below for a way of doing that).
      So the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(sens|respons)e and \1ibility
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "sense and sensibility" and "response and
      responsibility", but not "sense and responsibility". If
      caseful matching is in force at the time of the back
      reference, the case of letters is relevant. For example,</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
((?i)rah)\s+\1
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "rah rah" and "RAH RAH", but not "RAH rah", even
      though the original capturing subpattern is matched
      caselessly.</p>

      <p>There are several different ways of writing back
      references to named subpatterns. The .NET syntax \k{name} and
      the Perl syntax \k&lt;name&gt; or \k'name' are supported, as
      is the Python syntax (?P=name). Perl 5.10's unified back
      reference syntax, in which \g can be used for both numeric
      and named references, is also supported. We could rewrite the
      above example in any of the following ways:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">

</pre>
      </div>

      <p>A subpattern that is referenced by name may appear in the
      pattern before or after the reference.</p>

      <p>There may be more than one back reference to the same
      subpattern. If a subpattern has not actually been used in a
      particular match, any back references to it always fail by
      default. For example, the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a|(bc))\2
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>always fails if it starts to match "a" rather than "bc".
      However, if the PCRE2_MATCH_UNSET_BACKREF option is set at
      compile time, a back reference to an unset value matches an
      empty string.</p>

      <p>Because there may be many capturing parentheses in a
      pattern, all digits following a backslash are taken as part
      of a potential back reference number. If the pattern
      continues with a digit character, some delimiter must be used
      to terminate the back reference. If the PCRE2_EXTENDED option
      is set, this can be white space. Otherwise, the \g{ syntax or
      an empty comment (see "Comments" below) can be used.</p>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect42" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect42" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Recursive back references</h3>

        <p>A back reference that occurs inside the parentheses to
        which it refers fails when the subpattern is first used,
        so, for example, (a\1) never matches. However, such
        references can be useful inside repeated subpatterns. For
        example, the pattern</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a|b\1)+
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches any number of "a"s and also "aba", "ababbaa"
        etc. At each iteration of the subpattern, the back
        reference matches the character string corresponding to the
        previous iteration. In order for this to work, the pattern
        must be such that the first iteration does not need to
        match the back reference. This can be done using
        alternation, as in the example above, or by a quantifier
        with a minimum of zero.</p>

        <p>Back references of this type cause the group that they
        reference to be treated as an atomic group. Once the whole
        group has been matched, a subsequent matching failure
        cannot cause backtracking into the middle of the group.</p>

      <h2>ASSERTIONS</h2>

      <p>An assertion is a test on the characters following or
      preceding the current matching point that does not consume
      any characters. The simple assertions coded as \b, \B, \A,
      \G, \Z, \z, ^ and $ are described above.</p>

      <p>More complicated assertions are coded as subpatterns.
      There are two kinds: those that look ahead of the current
      position in the subject string, and those that look behind
      it. An assertion subpattern is matched in the normal way,
      except that it does not cause the current matching position
      to be changed.</p>

      <p>Assertion subpatterns are not capturing subpatterns. If
      such an assertion contains capturing subpatterns within it,
      these are counted for the purposes of numbering the capturing
      subpatterns in the whole pattern. However, substring
      capturing is carried out only for positive assertions. (Perl
      sometimes, but not always, does do capturing in negative
      assertions.)</p>

      <p>For compatibility with Perl, assertion subpatterns may be
      repeated; though it makes no sense to assert the same thing
      several times, the side effect of capturing parentheses may
      occasionally be useful. In practice, there only three
      cases:</p>

      <p>(1) If the quantifier is {0}, the assertion is never
      obeyed during matching. However, it may contain internal
      capturing parenthesized groups that are called from elsewhere
      via the subroutine mechanism.</p>

      <p>(2) If quantifier is {0,n} where n is greater than zero,
      it is treated as if it were {0,1}. At run time, the rest of
      the pattern match is tried with and without the assertion,
      the order depending on the greediness of the quantifier.</p>

      <p>(3) If the minimum repetition is greater than zero, the
      quantifier is ignored. The assertion is obeyed just once when
      encountered during matching.</p>

        <h3>Lookahead assertions</h3>

        <p>Lookahead assertions start with (?= for positive
        assertions and (?! for negative assertions. For
        example,</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\w+(?=;)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches a word followed by a semicolon, but does not
        include the semicolon in the match, and</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
foo(?!bar)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches any occurrence of "foo" that is not followed by
        "bar". Note that the apparently similar pattern</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?!foo)bar
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>does not find an occurrence of "bar" that is preceded by
        something other than "foo"; it finds any occurrence of
        "bar" whatsoever, because the assertion (?!foo) is always
        true when the next three characters are "bar". A lookbehind
        assertion is needed to achieve the other effect.</p>

        <p>If you want to force a matching failure at some point in
        a pattern, the most convenient way to do it is with (?!)
        because an empty string always matches, so an assertion
        that requires there not to be an empty string must always
        fail. The backtracking control verb (*FAIL) or (*F) is a
        synonym for (?!).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect45" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect45" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Lookbehind assertions</h3>

        <p>Lookbehind assertions start with (?&lt;= for positive
        assertions and (?&lt;! for negative assertions. For
        example,</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;!foo)bar
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>does find an occurrence of "bar" that is not preceded by
        "foo". The contents of a lookbehind assertion are
        restricted such that all the strings it matches must have a
        fixed length. However, if there are several top-level
        alternatives, they do not all have to have the same fixed
        length. Thus</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=bullock|donkey)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>is permitted, but</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;!dogs?|cats?)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>causes an error at compile time. Branches that match
        different length strings are permitted only at the top
        level of a lookbehind assertion. This is an extension
        compared with Perl, which requires all branches to match
        the same length of string. An assertion such as</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=ab(c|de))
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>is not permitted, because its single top-level branch
        can match two different lengths, but it is acceptable to
        PCRE2 if rewritten to use two top-level branches:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=abc|abde)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>In some cases, the escape sequence \K (see above) can be
        used instead of a lookbehind assertion to get round the
        fixed-length restriction.</p>

        <p>The implementation of lookbehind assertions is, for each
        alternative, to temporarily move the current position back
        by the fixed length and then try to match. If there are
        insufficient characters before the current position, the
        assertion fails.</p>

        <p>In a UTF mode, PCRE2 does not allow the \C escape (which
        matches a single code unit even in a UTF mode) to appear in
        lookbehind assertions, because it makes it impossible to
        calculate the length of the lookbehind. The \X and \R
        escapes, which can match different numbers of code units,
        are also not permitted.</p>

        <p>"Subroutine" calls (see below) such as (?2) or (?&amp;X)
        are permitted in lookbehinds, as long as the subpattern
        matches a fixed-length string. Recursion, however, is not
        supported.</p>

        <p>Possessive quantifiers can be used in conjunction with
        lookbehind assertions to specify efficient matching of
        fixed-length strings at the end of subject strings.
        Consider a simple pattern such as</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
abcd$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>when applied to a long string that does not match.
        Because matching proceeds from left to right, PCRE2 will
        look for each "a" in the subject and then see if what
        follows matches the rest of the pattern. If the pattern is
        specified as</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^.*abcd$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>the initial .* matches the entire string at first, but
        when this fails (because there is no following "a"), it
        backtracks to match all but the last character, then all
        but the last two characters, and so on. Once again the
        search for "a" covers the entire string, from right to
        left, so we are no better off. However, if the pattern is
        written as</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^.*+(?&lt;=abcd)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>there can be no backtracking for the .*+ item because of
        the possessive quantifier; it can match only the entire
        string. The subsequent lookbehind assertion does a single
        test on the last four characters. If it fails, the match
        fails immediately. For long strings, this approach makes a
        significant difference to the processing time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect46" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect46" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Using multiple assertions</h3>

        <p>Several assertions (of any sort) may occur in
        succession. For example,</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=\d{3})(?&lt;!999)foo
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches "foo" preceded by three digits that are not
        "999". Notice that each of the assertions is applied
        independently at the same point in the subject string.
        First there is a check that the previous three characters
        are all digits, and then there is a check that the same
        three characters are not "999". This pattern does
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> match "foo"
        preceded by six characters, the first of which are digits
        and the last three of which are not "999". For example, it
        doesn't match "123abcfoo". A pattern to do that is</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=\d{3}...)(?&lt;!999)foo
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This time the first assertion looks at the preceding six
        characters, checking that the first three are digits, and
        then the second assertion checks that the preceding three
        characters are not "999".</p>

        <p>Assertions can be nested in any combination. For
        example,</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=(?&lt;!foo)bar)baz
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>matches an occurrence of "baz" that is preceded by "bar"
        which in turn is not preceded by "foo", while</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;=\d{3}(?!999)...)foo
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>is another pattern that matches "foo" preceded by three
        digits and any three characters that are not "999".</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect47" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect47" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>CONDITIONAL SUBPATTERNS</h2>

      <p>It is possible to cause the matching process to obey a
      subpattern conditionally or to choose between two alternative
      subpatterns, depending on the result of an assertion, or
      whether a specific capturing subpattern has already been
      matched. The two possible forms of conditional subpattern
      are:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?(condition)yes-pattern)
 (?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the condition is satisfied, the yes-pattern is used;
      otherwise the no-pattern (if present) is used. If there are
      more than two alternatives in the subpattern, a compile-time
      error occurs. Each of the two alternatives may itself contain
      nested subpatterns of any form, including conditional
      subpatterns; the restriction to two alternatives applies only
      at the level of the condition. This pattern fragment is an
      example where the alternatives are complex:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?(1) (A|B|C) | (D | (?(2)E|F) | E) )
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>There are five kinds of condition: references to
      subpatterns, references to recursion, two pseudo-conditions
      called DEFINE and VERSION, and assertions.</p>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect48" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect48" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Checking for a used subpattern by number</h3>

        <p>If the text between the parentheses consists of a
        sequence of digits, the condition is true if a capturing
        subpattern of that number has previously matched. If there
        is more than one capturing subpattern with the same number
        (see the earlier section about duplicate subpattern
        numbers), the condition is true if any of them have
        matched. An alternative notation is to precede the digits
        with a plus or minus sign. In this case, the subpattern
        number is relative rather than absolute. The most recently
        opened parentheses can be referenced by (?(-1), the next
        most recent by (?(-2), and so on. Inside loops it can also
        make sense to refer to subsequent groups. The next
        parentheses to be opened can be referenced as (?(+1), and
        so on. (The value zero in any of these forms is not used;
        it provokes a compile-time error.)</p>

        <p>Consider the following pattern, which contains
        non-significant white space to make it more readable
        (assume the PCRE2_EXTENDED option) and to divide it into
        three parts for ease of discussion:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
( \( )?    [^()]+    (?(1) \) )
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The first part matches an optional opening parenthesis,
        and if that character is present, sets it as the first
        captured substring. The second part matches one or more
        characters that are not parentheses. The third part is a
        conditional subpattern that tests whether or not the first
        set of parentheses matched. If they did, that is, if
        subject started with an opening parenthesis, the condition
        is true, and so the yes-pattern is executed and a closing
        parenthesis is required. Otherwise, since no-pattern is not
        present, the subpattern matches nothing. In other words,
        this pattern matches a sequence of non-parentheses,
        optionally enclosed in parentheses.</p>

        <p>If you were embedding this pattern in a larger one, you
        could use a relative reference:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
...other stuff... ( \( )?    [^()]+    (?(-1) \) ) ...
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This makes the fragment independent of the parentheses
        in the larger pattern.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect49" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect49" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Checking for a used subpattern by name</h3>

        <p>Perl uses the syntax (?(&lt;name&gt;)...) or
        (?('name')...) to test for a used subpattern by name. For
        compatibility with earlier versions of PCRE1, which had
        this facility before Perl, the syntax (?(name)...) is also
        recognized.</p>

        <p>Rewriting the above example to use a named subpattern
        gives this:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;OPEN&gt; \( )?    [^()]+    (?(&lt;OPEN&gt;) \) )
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If the name used in a condition of this kind is a
        duplicate, the test is applied to all subpatterns of the
        same name, and is true if any one of them has matched.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect50" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect50" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Checking for pattern recursion</h3>

        <p>If the condition is the string (R), and there is no
        subpattern with the name R, the condition is true if a
        recursive call to the whole pattern or any subpattern has
        been made. If digits or a name preceded by ampersand follow
        the letter R, for example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?(R3)...) or (?(R&amp;name)...)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>the condition is true if the most recent recursion is
        into a subpattern whose number or name is given. This
        condition does not check the entire recursion stack. If the
        name used in a condition of this kind is a duplicate, the
        test is applied to all subpatterns of the same name, and is
        true if any one of them is the most recent recursion.</p>

        <p>At "top level", all these recursion test conditions are
        false. The syntax for recursive patterns is described
        below.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect51" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect51" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Defining subpatterns for use by reference only</h3>

        <p>If the condition is the string (DEFINE), and there is no
        subpattern with the name DEFINE, the condition is always
        false. In this case, there may be only one alternative in
        the subpattern. It is always skipped if control reaches
        this point in the pattern; the idea of DEFINE is that it
        can be used to define subroutines that can be referenced
        from elsewhere. (The use of subroutines is described
        below.) For example, a pattern to match an IPv4 address
        such as "192.168.23.245" could be written like this (ignore
        white space and line breaks):</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?(DEFINE) (?&lt;byte&gt; 2[0-4]\d | 25[0-5] | 1\d\d | [1-9]?\d) )
 \b (?&amp;byte) (\.(?&amp;byte)){3} \b
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The first part of the pattern is a DEFINE group inside
        which a another group named "byte" is defined. This matches
        an individual component of an IPv4 address (a number less
        than 256). When matching takes place, this part of the
        pattern is skipped because DEFINE acts like a false
        condition. The rest of the pattern uses references to the
        named group to match the four dot-separated components of
        an IPv4 address, insisting on a word boundary at each
        end.</p>

        <h3>Checking the PCRE2 version</h3>

        <p>Programs that link with a PCRE2 library can check the

        arguments. Users of applications that do not have access to
        the underlying code cannot do this. A special "condition"
        called VERSION exists to allow such users to discover which
        version of PCRE2 they are dealing with by using this
        condition to match a string such as "yesno". VERSION must
        be followed either by "=" or "&gt;=" and a version number.
        For example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?(VERSION&gt;=10.4)yes|no)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This pattern matches "yes" if the PCRE2 version is
        greater or equal to 10.4, or "no" otherwise.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect53" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect53" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Assertion conditions</h3>

        <p>If the condition is not in any of the above formats, it
        must be an assertion. This may be a positive or negative
        lookahead or lookbehind assertion. Consider this pattern,
        again containing non-significant white space, and with the
        two alternatives on the second line:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?(?=[^a-z]*[a-z])
 \d{2}-[a-z]{3}-\d{2}  |  \d{2}-\d{2}-\d{2} )
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The condition is a positive lookahead assertion that
        matches an optional sequence of non-letters followed by a
        letter. In other words, it tests for the presence of at
        least one letter in the subject. If a letter is found, the
        subject is matched against the first alternative; otherwise
        it is matched against the second. This pattern matches
        strings in one of the two forms dd-aaa-dd or dd-dd-dd,
        where aaa are letters and dd are digits.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect54" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect54" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>COMMENTS</h2>

      <p>There are two ways of including comments in patterns that
      are processed by PCRE2. In both cases, the start of the
      comment must not be in a character class, nor in the middle
      of any other sequence of related characters such as (?: or a
      subpattern name or number. The characters that make up a
      comment play no part in the pattern matching.</p>

      <p>The sequence (?# marks the start of a comment that
      continues up to the next closing parenthesis. Nested
      parentheses are not permitted. If the PCRE2_EXTENDED option
      is set, an unescaped # character also introduces a comment,
      which in this case continues to immediately after the next
      newline character or character sequence in the pattern. Which
      characters are interpreted as newlines is controlled by an
      option passed to the compiling function or by a special
      sequence at the start of the pattern, as described in the
      section entitled "Newline conventions" above. Note that the
      end of this type of comment is a literal newline sequence in
      the pattern; escape sequences that happen to represent a
      newline do not count. For example, consider this pattern when
      PCRE2_EXTENDED is set, and the default newline convention (a
      single linefeed character) is in force:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
abc #comment \n still comment
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>On encountering the # character, <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>() skips along, looking for a
      newline in the pattern. The sequence \n is still literal at
      this stage, so it does not terminate the comment. Only an
      actual character with the code value 0x0a (the default
      newline) does so.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>RECURSIVE PATTERNS</h2>

      <p>Consider the problem of matching a string in parentheses,
      allowing for unlimited nested parentheses. Without the use of
      recursion, the best that can be done is to use a pattern that
      matches up to some fixed depth of nesting. It is not possible
      to handle an arbitrary nesting depth.</p>

      <p>For some time, Perl has provided a facility that allows
      regular expressions to recurse (amongst other things). It
      does this by interpolating Perl code in the expression at run
      time, and the code can refer to the expression itself. A Perl
      pattern using code interpolation to solve the parentheses
      problem can be created like this:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
$re = qr{\( (?: (?&gt;[^()]+) | (?p{$re}) )* \)}x;
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The (?p{...}) item interpolates Perl code at run time, and
      in this case refers recursively to the pattern in which it
      appears.</p>

      <p>Obviously, PCRE2 cannot support the interpolation of Perl
      code. Instead, it supports special syntax for recursion of
      the entire pattern, and also for individual subpattern
      recursion. After its introduction in PCRE1 and Python, this
      kind of recursion was subsequently introduced into Perl at
      release 5.10.</p>

      <p>A special item that consists of (? followed by a number
      greater than zero and a closing parenthesis is a recursive
      subroutine call of the subpattern of the given number,
      provided that it occurs inside that subpattern. (If not, it
      is a non-recursive subroutine call, which is described in the
      next section.) The special item (?R) or (?0) is a recursive
      call of the entire regular expression.</p>

      <p>This PCRE2 pattern solves the nested parentheses problem
      (assume the PCRE2_EXTENDED option is set so that white space
      is ignored):</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
\( ( [^()]++ | (?R) )* \)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>First it matches an opening parenthesis. Then it matches
      any number of substrings which can either be a sequence of
      non-parentheses, or a recursive match of the pattern itself
      (that is, a correctly parenthesized substring). Finally there
      is a closing parenthesis. Note the use of a possessive
      quantifier to avoid backtracking into sequences of
      non-parentheses.</p>

      <p>If this were part of a larger pattern, you would not want
      to recurse the entire pattern, so instead you could use
      this:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
( \( ( [^()]++ | (?1) )* \) )
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>We have put the pattern into parentheses, and caused the
      recursion to refer to them instead of the whole pattern.</p>

      <p>In a larger pattern, keeping track of parenthesis numbers
      can be tricky. This is made easier by the use of relative
      references. Instead of (?1) in the pattern above you can
      write (?-2) to refer to the second most recently opened
      parentheses preceding the recursion. In other words, a
      negative number counts capturing parentheses leftwards from
      the point at which it is encountered.</p>

      <p>It is also possible to refer to subsequently opened
      parentheses, by writing references such as (?+2). However,
      these cannot be recursive because the reference is not inside
      the parentheses that are referenced. They are always
      non-recursive subroutine calls, as described in the next
      section.</p>

      <p>An alternative approach is to use named parentheses. The
      Perl syntax for this is (?&amp;name); PCRE1's earlier syntax
      (?P&gt;name) is also supported. We could rewrite the above
      example as follows:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?&lt;pn&gt; \( ( [^()]++ | (?&amp;pn) )* \) )
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If there is more than one subpattern with the same name,
      the earliest one is used.</p>

      <p>The example pattern that we have been looking at contains
      nested unlimited repeats, and so the use of a possessive
      quantifier for matching strings of non-parentheses is
      important when applying the pattern to strings that do not
      match. For example, when this pattern is applied to</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa()
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>it yields "no match" quickly. However, if a possessive
      quantifier is not used, the match runs for a very long time
      indeed because there are so many different ways the + and *
      repeats can carve up the subject, and all have to be tested
      before failure can be reported.</p>

      <p>At the end of a match, the values of capturing parentheses
      are those from the outermost level. If you want to obtain
      intermediate values, a callout function can be used (see
      below and the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2callout.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2callout</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation). If the pattern above is matched against</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(ab(cd)ef)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>the value for the inner capturing parentheses (numbered 2)
      is "ef", which is the last value taken on at the top level.
      If a capturing subpattern is not matched at the top level,
      its final captured value is unset, even if it was
      (temporarily) set at a deeper level during the matching
      process.</p>

      <p>If there are more than 15 capturing parentheses in a
      pattern, PCRE2 has to obtain extra memory from the heap to
      store data during a recursion. If no memory can be obtained,
      the match fails with the PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY error.</p>

      <p>Do not confuse the (?R) item with the condition (R), which
      tests for recursion. Consider this pattern, which matches
      text in angle brackets, allowing for arbitrary nesting. Only
      digits are allowed in nested brackets (that is, when
      recursing), whereas any characters are permitted at the outer
      level.</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
&lt; (?: (?(R) \d++  | [^&lt;&gt;]*+) | (?R)) * &gt;
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>In this pattern, (?(R) is the start of a conditional
      subpattern, with two different alternatives for the recursive
      and non-recursive cases. The (?R) item is the actual
      recursive call.</p>

        <h3>Differences in recursion processing between PCRE2 and
        Perl</h3>

        <p>Recursion processing in PCRE2 differs from Perl in two
        important ways. In PCRE2 (like Python, but unlike Perl), a
        recursive subpattern call is always treated as an atomic
        group. That is, once it has matched some of the subject
        string, it is never re-entered, even if it contains untried
        alternatives and there is a subsequent matching failure.
        This can be illustrated by the following pattern, which
        purports to match a palindromic string that contains an odd
        number of characters (for example, "a", "aba", "abcba",
        "abcdcba"):</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^(.|(.)(?1)\2)$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The idea is that it either matches a single character,
        or two identical characters surrounding a sub-palindrome.
        In Perl, this pattern works; in PCRE2 it does not if the
        pattern is longer than three characters. Consider the
        subject string "abcba":</p>

        <p>At the top level, the first character is matched, but as
        it is not at the end of the string, the first alternative
        fails; the second alternative is taken and the recursion
        kicks in. The recursive call to subpattern 1 successfully
        matches the next character ("b"). (Note that the beginning
        and end of line tests are not part of the recursion).</p>

        <p>Back at the top level, the next character ("c") is
        compared with what subpattern 2 matched, which was "a".
        This fails. Because the recursion is treated as an atomic
        group, there are now no backtracking points, and so the
        entire match fails. (Perl is able, at this point, to
        re-enter the recursion and try the second alternative.)
        However, if the pattern is written with the alternatives in
        the other order, things are different:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^((.)(?1)\2|.)$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This time, the recursing alternative is tried first, and
        continues to recurse until it runs out of characters, at
        which point the recursion fails. But this time we do have
        another alternative to try at the higher level. That is the
        big difference: in the previous case the remaining
        alternative is at a deeper recursion level, which PCRE2
        cannot use.</p>

        <p>To change the pattern so that it matches all palindromic
        strings, not just those with an odd number of characters,
        it is tempting to change the pattern to this:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^((.)(?1)\2|.?)$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Again, this works in Perl, but not in PCRE2, and for the
        same reason. When a deeper recursion has matched a single
        character, it cannot be entered again in order to match an
        empty string. The solution is to separate the two cases,
        and write out the odd and even cases as alternatives at the
        higher level:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^(?:((.)(?1)\2|)|((.)(?3)\4|.))
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If you want to match typical palindromic phrases, the
        pattern has to ignore all non-word characters, which can be
        done like this:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^\W*+(?:((.)\W*+(?1)\W*+\2|)|((.)\W*+(?3)\W*+\4|\W*+.\W*+))\W*+$
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If run with the PCRE2_CASELESS option, this pattern
        matches phrases such as "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama!"
        and it works in both PCRE2 and Perl. Note the use of the
        possessive quantifier *+ to avoid backtracking into
        sequences of non-word characters. Without this, PCRE2 takes
        a great deal longer (ten times or more) to match typical
        phrases, and Perl takes so long that you think it has gone
        into a loop.</p>

        <p><code class="constant">WARNING</code>: The
        palindrome-matching patterns above work only if the subject
        string does not start with a palindrome that is shorter
        than the entire string. For example, although "abcba" is
        correctly matched, if the subject is "ababa", PCRE2 finds
        the palindrome "aba" at the start, then fails at top level
        because the end of the string does not follow. Once again,
        it cannot jump back into the recursion to try other
        alternatives, so the entire match fails.</p>

        <p>The second way in which PCRE2 and Perl differ in their
        recursion processing is in the handling of captured values.
        In Perl, when a subpattern is called recursively or as a
        subpattern (see the next section), it has no access to any
        values that were captured outside the recursion, whereas in
        PCRE2 these values can be referenced. Consider this
        pattern:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^(.)(\1|a(?2))
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>In PCRE2, this pattern matches "bab". The first
        capturing parentheses match "b", then in the second group,
        when the back reference \1 fails to match "b", the second
        alternative matches "a" and then recurses. In the
        recursion, \1 does now match "b" and so the whole match
        succeeds. In Perl, the pattern fails to match because
        inside the recursive call \1 cannot access the externally
        set value.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>SUBPATTERNS AS SUBROUTINES</h2>

      <p>If the syntax for a recursive subpattern call (either by
      number or by name) is used outside the parentheses to which
      it refers, it operates like a subroutine in a programming
      language. The called subpattern may be defined before or
      after the reference. A numbered reference can be absolute or
      relative, as in these examples:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (...(absolute)...)...(?2)...
 (...(relative)...)...(?-1)...
 (...(?+1)...(relative)...
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>An earlier example pointed out that the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(sens|respons)e and \1ibility
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches "sense and sensibility" and "response and
      responsibility", but not "sense and responsibility". If
      instead the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(sens|respons)e and (?1)ibility
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>is used, it does match "sense and responsibility" as well
      as the other two strings. Another example is given in the
      discussion of DEFINE above.</p>

      <p>All subroutine calls, whether recursive or not, are always
      treated as atomic groups. That is, once a subroutine has
      matched some of the subject string, it is never re-entered,
      even if it contains untried alternatives and there is a
      subsequent matching failure. Any capturing parentheses that
      are set during the subroutine call revert to their previous
      values afterwards.</p>

      <p>Processing options such as case-independence are fixed
      when a subpattern is defined, so if it is used as a
      subroutine, such options cannot be changed for different
      calls. For example, consider this pattern:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc)(?i:(?-1))
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>It matches "abcabc". It does not match "abcABC" because
      the change of processing option does not affect the called
      subpattern.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect58" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect58" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>ONIGURUMA SUBROUTINE SYNTAX</h2>

      <p>For compatibility with Oniguruma, the non-Perl syntax \g
      followed by a name or a number enclosed either in angle
      brackets or single quotes, is an alternative syntax for
      referencing a subpattern as a subroutine, possibly
      recursively. Here are two of the examples used above,
      rewritten using this syntax:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (?&lt;pn&gt; \( ( (?&gt;[^()]+) | \g&lt;pn&gt; )* \) )
 (sens|respons)e and \g'1'ibility
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>PCRE2 supports an extension to Oniguruma: if a number is
      preceded by a plus or a minus sign it is taken as a relative
      reference. For example:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc)(?i:\g&lt;-1&gt;)
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>Note that \g{...} (Perl syntax) and \g&lt;...&gt;
      (Oniguruma syntax) are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> synonymous. The former is a
      back reference; the latter is a subroutine call.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect59" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect59" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>CALLOUTS</h2>

      <p>Perl has a feature whereby using the sequence (?{...})
      causes arbitrary Perl code to be obeyed in the middle of
      matching a regular expression. This makes it possible,
      amongst other things, to extract different substrings that
      match the same pair of parentheses when there is a
      repetition.</p>

      <p>PCRE2 provides a similar feature, but of course it cannot
      obey arbitrary Perl code. The feature is called "callout".
      The caller of PCRE2 provides an external function by putting
      its entry point in a match context using the function
      <code class="function">pcre2_set_callout</code>() and passing
      the context to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() or
      <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>(). If no match
      context is passed, or if the callout entry point is set to
      NULL, callouts are disabled.</p>

      <p>Within a regular expression, (?C) indicates the points at
      which the external function is to be called. If you want to
      identify different callout points, you can put a number less
      than 256 after the letter C. The default value is zero. For
      example, this pattern has two callout points:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(?C1)abc(?C2)def
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If the PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT flag is passed to <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(), callouts are automatically
      installed before each item in the pattern. They are all
      numbered 255. If there is a conditional group in the pattern
      whose condition is an assertion, an additional callout is
      inserted just before the condition. An explicit callout may
      also be set at this position, as in this example:</p>

      <p>Note that this applies only to assertion conditions, not
      to other types of condition.</p>

      <p>During matching, when PCRE2 reaches a callout point, the
      external function is called. It is provided with the number
      of the callout, the position in the pattern, and one item of
      data that is also set in the match block. The callout
      function may cause matching to proceed, to backtrack, or to
      fail.</p>

      <p>By default, PCRE2 implements a number of optimizations at
      matching time, and one side-effect is that sometimes callouts
      are skipped. If you need all possible callouts to happen, you
      need to set options that disable the relevant optimizations.
      More details, and a complete description of the interface to
      the callout function, are given in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2callout.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2callout</span>(3)</span></a>

      <h2>BACKTRACKING CONTROL</h2>

      <p>Perl 5.10 introduced a number of "Special Backtracking
      Control Verbs", which are still described in the Perl
      documentation as "experimental and subject to change or
      removal in a future version of Perl". It goes on to say:
      "Their usage in production code should be noted to avoid
      problems during upgrades." The same remarks apply to the
      PCRE2 features described in this section.</p>

      <p>The new verbs make use of what was previously invalid
      syntax: an opening parenthesis followed by an asterisk. They
      are generally of the form (*VERB) or (*VERB:NAME). Some may
      take either form, possibly behaving differently depending on
      whether or not a name is present. A name is any sequence of
      characters that does not include a closing parenthesis. The
      maximum length of name is 255 in the 8-bit library and 65535
      in the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries. If the name is empty,
      that is, if the closing parenthesis immediately follows the
      colon, the effect is as if the colon were not there. Any
      number of these verbs may occur in a pattern.</p>

      <p>Since these verbs are specifically related to
      backtracking, most of them can be used only when the pattern
      is to be matched using the traditional matching function,
      because these use a backtracking algorithm. With the
      exception of (*FAIL), which behaves like a failing negative
      assertion, the backtracking control verbs cause an error if
      encountered by the DFA matching function.</p>

      <p>The behaviour of these verbs in repeated groups,
      assertions, and in subpatterns called as subroutines (whether
      or not recursively) is documented below.</p>

        <h3>Optimizations that affect backtracking verbs</h3>

        <p>PCRE2 contains some optimizations that are used to speed
        up matching by running some checks at the start of each
        match attempt. For example, it may know the minimum length
        of matching subject, or that a particular character must be
        present. When one of these optimizations bypasses the
        running of a match, any included backtracking verbs will
        not, of course, be processed. You can suppress the
        start-of-match optimizations by setting the
        PCRE2_NO_START_OPTIMIZE option when calling <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(), or by starting the
        pattern with (*NO_START_OPT). There is more discussion of
        this option in the section entitled "Compiling a pattern"
        in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation.</p>

        <p>Experiments with Perl suggest that it too has similar
        optimizations, sometimes leading to anomalous results.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Verbs that act immediately</h3>

        <p>The following verbs act as soon as they are encountered.
        They may not be followed by a name.</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*ACCEPT)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb causes the match to end successfully, skipping
        the remainder of the pattern. However, when it is inside a
        subpattern that is called as a subroutine, only that
        subpattern is ended successfully. Matching then continues
        at the outer level. If (*ACCEPT) in triggered in a positive
        assertion, the assertion succeeds; in a negative assertion,
        the assertion fails.</p>

        <p>If (*ACCEPT) is inside capturing parentheses, the data
        so far is captured. For example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
A((?:A|B(*ACCEPT)|C)D)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This matches "AB", "AAD", or "ACD"; when it matches
        "AB", "B" is captured by the outer parentheses.</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*FAIL) or (*F)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb causes a matching failure, forcing
        backtracking to occur. It is equivalent to (?!) but easier
        to read. The Perl documentation notes that it is probably
        useful only when combined with (?{}) or (??{}). Those are,
        of course, Perl features that are not present in PCRE2. The
        nearest equivalent is the callout feature, as for example
        in this pattern:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
a+(?C)(*FAIL)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>A match with the string "aaaa" always fails, but the
        callout is taken before each backtrack happens (in this
        example, 10 times).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect63" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect63" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Recording which path was taken</h3>

        <p>There is one verb whose main purpose is to track how a
        match was arrived at, though it also has a secondary use in
        conjunction with advancing the match starting point (see
        (*SKIP) below).</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*MARK:NAME) or (*:NAME)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>A name is always required with this verb. There may be
        as many instances of (*MARK) as you like in a pattern, and
        their names do not have to be unique.</p>

        <p>When a match succeeds, the name of the last-encountered
        (*MARK:NAME), (*PRUNE:NAME), or (*THEN:NAME) on the
        matching path is passed back to the caller as described in
        the section entitled "Other information about the match" in
        the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation. Here is an example of <code class="function">pcre2test</code> output, where the "mark"
        modifier requests the retrieval and outputting of (*MARK)
        data:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /X(*MARK:A)Y|X(*MARK:B)Z/mark
 data&gt; XY
  0: XY
 MK: A
 XZ
  0: XZ
 MK: B
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The (*MARK) name is tagged with "MK:" in this output,
        and in this example it indicates which of the two
        alternatives matched. This is a more efficient way of
        obtaining this information than putting each alternative in
        its own capturing parentheses.</p>

        <p>If a verb with a name is encountered in a positive
        assertion that is true, the name is recorded and passed
        back if it is the last-encountered. This does not happen
        for negative assertions or failing positive assertions.</p>

        <p>After a partial match or a failed match, the last
        encountered name in the entire match process is returned.
        For example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /X(*MARK:A)Y|X(*MARK:B)Z/mark
 data&gt; XP
 No match, mark = B
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Note that in this unanchored example the mark is
        retained from the match attempt that started at the letter
        "X" in the subject. Subsequent match attempts starting at
        "P" and then with an empty string do not get as far as the
        (*MARK) item, but nevertheless do not reset it.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in (*MARK) values after failed
        matches, you should probably set the
        PCRE2_NO_START_OPTIMIZE option (see above) to ensure that
        the match is always attempted.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect64" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect64" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Verbs that act after backtracking</h3>

        <p>The following verbs do nothing when they are
        encountered. Matching continues with what follows, but if
        there is no subsequent match, causing a backtrack to the
        verb, a failure is forced. That is, backtracking cannot
        pass to the left of the verb. However, when one of these
        verbs appears inside an atomic group (which includes any
        group that is called as a subroutine) or in an assertion
        that is true, its effect is confined to that group, because
        once the group has been matched, there is never any
        backtracking into it. In this situation, backtracking has
        to jump to the left of the entire atomic group or
        assertion.</p>

        <p>These verbs differ in exactly what kind of failure
        occurs when backtracking reaches them. The behaviour
        described below is what happens when the verb is not in a
        subroutine or an assertion. Subsequent sections cover these
        special cases.</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*COMMIT)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb, which may not be followed by a name, causes
        the whole match to fail outright if there is a later
        matching failure that causes backtracking to reach it. Even
        if the pattern is unanchored, no further attempts to find a
        match by advancing the starting point take place. If
        (*COMMIT) is the only backtracking verb that is
        encountered, once it has been passed <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is committed to finding a
        match at the current starting point, or not at all. For
        example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
a+(*COMMIT)b
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This matches "xxaab" but not "aacaab". It can be thought
        of as a kind of dynamic anchor, or "I've started, so I must
        finish." The name of the most recently passed (*MARK) in
        the path is passed back when (*COMMIT) forces a match
        failure.</p>

        <p>If there is more than one backtracking verb in a
        pattern, a different one that follows (*COMMIT) may be
        triggered first, so merely passing (*COMMIT) during a match
        does not always guarantee that a match must be at this
        starting point.</p>

        <p>Note that (*COMMIT) at the start of a pattern is not the
        same as an anchor, unless PCRE2's start-of-match
        optimizations are turned off, as shown in this output from
        <code class="function">pcre2test</code>:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /(*COMMIT)abc/
 data&gt; xyzabc
  0: abc
 data&gt;
 re&gt; /(*COMMIT)abc/no_start_optimize
 data&gt; xyzabc
 No match
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>For the first pattern, PCRE2 knows that any match must
        start with "a", so the optimization skips along the subject
        to "a" before applying the pattern to the first set of
        data. The match attempt then succeeds. The second pattern
        disables the optimization that skips along to the first
        character. The pattern is now applied starting at "x", and
        so the (*COMMIT) causes the match to fail without trying
        any other starting points.</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*PRUNE) or (*PRUNE:NAME)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb causes the match to fail at the current
        starting position in the subject if there is a later
        matching failure that causes backtracking to reach it. If
        the pattern is unanchored, the normal "bumpalong" advance
        to the next starting character then happens. Backtracking
        can occur as usual to the left of (*PRUNE), before it is
        reached, or when matching to the right of (*PRUNE), but if
        there is no match to the right, backtracking cannot cross
        (*PRUNE). In simple cases, the use of (*PRUNE) is just an
        alternative to an atomic group or possessive quantifier,
        but there are some uses of (*PRUNE) that cannot be
        expressed in any other way. In an anchored pattern (*PRUNE)
        has the same effect as (*COMMIT).</p>

        <p>The behaviour of (*PRUNE:NAME) is the not the same as
        (*MARK:NAME)(*PRUNE). It is like (*MARK:NAME) in that the
        name is remembered for passing back to the caller. However,
        (*SKIP:NAME) searches only for names set with (*MARK),
        ignoring those set by (*PRUNE) or (*THEN).</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*SKIP)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb, when given without a name, is like (*PRUNE),
        except that if the pattern is unanchored, the "bumpalong"
        advance is not to the next character, but to the position
        in the subject where (*SKIP) was encountered. (*SKIP)
        signifies that whatever text was matched leading up to it
        cannot be part of a successful match. Consider:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
a+(*SKIP)b
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If the subject is "aaaac...", after the first match
        attempt fails (starting at the first character in the
        string), the starting point skips on to start the next
        attempt at "c". Note that a possessive quantifer does not
        have the same effect as this example; although it would
        suppress backtracking during the first match attempt, the
        second attempt would start at the second character instead
        of skipping on to "c".</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*SKIP:NAME)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>When (*SKIP) has an associated name, its behaviour is
        modified. When it is triggered, the previous path through
        the pattern is searched for the most recent (*MARK) that
        has the same name. If one is found, the "bumpalong" advance
        is to the subject position that corresponds to that (*MARK)
        instead of to where (*SKIP) was encountered. If no (*MARK)
        with a matching name is found, the (*SKIP) is ignored.</p>

        <p>Note that (*SKIP:NAME) searches only for names set by
        (*MARK:NAME). It ignores names that are set by
        (*PRUNE:NAME) or (*THEN:NAME).</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(*THEN) or (*THEN:NAME)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This verb causes a skip to the next innermost
        alternative when backtracking reaches it. That is, it
        cancels any further backtracking within the current
        alternative. Its name comes from the observation that it
        can be used for a pattern-based if-then-else block:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
( COND1 (*THEN) FOO | COND2 (*THEN) BAR | COND3 (*THEN) BAZ ) ...
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If the COND1 pattern matches, FOO is tried (and possibly
        further items after the end of the group if FOO succeeds);
        on failure, the matcher skips to the second alternative and
        tries COND2, without backtracking into COND1. If that
        succeeds and BAR fails, COND3 is tried. If subsequently BAZ
        fails, there are no more alternatives, so there is a
        backtrack to whatever came before the entire group. If
        (*THEN) is not inside an alternation, it acts like
        (*PRUNE).</p>

        <p>The behaviour of (*THEN:NAME) is the not the same as
        (*MARK:NAME)(*THEN). It is like (*MARK:NAME) in that the
        name is remembered for passing back to the caller. However,
        (*SKIP:NAME) searches only for names set with (*MARK),
        ignoring those set by (*PRUNE) and (*THEN).</p>

        <p>A subpattern that does not contain a | character is just
        a part of the enclosing alternative; it is not a nested
        alternation with only one alternative. The effect of
        (*THEN) extends beyond such a subpattern to the enclosing
        alternative. Consider this pattern, where A, B, etc. are
        complex pattern fragments that do not contain any |
        characters at this level:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
A (B(*THEN)C) | D
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If A and B are matched, but there is a failure in C,
        matching does not backtrack into A; instead it moves to the
        next alternative, that is, D. However, if the subpattern
        containing (*THEN) is given an alternative, it behaves
        differently:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
A (B(*THEN)C | (*FAIL)) | D
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>The effect of (*THEN) is now confined to the inner
        subpattern. After a failure in C, matching moves to
        (*FAIL), which causes the whole subpattern to fail because
        there are no more alternatives to try. In this case,
        matching does now backtrack into A.</p>

        <p>Note that a conditional subpattern is not considered as
        having two alternatives, because only one is ever used. In
        other words, the | character in a conditional subpattern
        has a different meaning. Ignoring white space,
        consider:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^.*? (?(?=a) a | b(*THEN)c )
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If the subject is "ba", this pattern does not match.
        Because .*? is ungreedy, it initially matches zero
        characters. The condition (?=a) then fails, the character
        "b" is matched, but "c" is not. At this point, matching
        does not backtrack to .*? as might perhaps be expected from
        the presence of the | character. The conditional subpattern
        is part of the single alternative that comprises the whole
        pattern, and so the match fails. (If there was a backtrack
        into .*?, allowing it to match "b", the match would
        succeed.)</p>

        <p>The verbs just described provide four different
        "strengths" of control when subsequent matching fails.
        (*THEN) is the weakest, carrying on the match at the next
        alternative. (*PRUNE) comes next, failing the match at the
        current starting position, but allowing an advance to the
        next character (for an unanchored pattern). (*SKIP) is
        similar, except that the advance may be more than one
        character. (*COMMIT) is the strongest, causing the entire
        match to fail.</p>
      </div>

        <a id="pcre2pattern-3_sect65" name="pcre2pattern-3_sect65" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>More than one backtracking verb</h3>

        <p>If more than one backtracking verb is present in a
        pattern, the one that is backtracked onto first acts. For
        example, consider this pattern, where A, B, etc. are
        complex pattern fragments:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(A(*COMMIT)B(*THEN)C|ABD)
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If A matches but B fails, the backtrack to (*COMMIT)
        causes the entire match to fail. However, if A and B match,
        but C fails, the backtrack to (*THEN) causes the next
        alternative (ABD) to be tried. This behaviour is
        consistent, but is not always the same as Perl's. It means
        that if two or more backtracking verbs appear in
        succession, all the the last of them has no effect.
        Consider this example:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
...(*COMMIT)(*PRUNE)...
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If there is a matching failure to the right,
        backtracking onto (*PRUNE) causes it to be triggered, and
        its action is taken. There can never be a backtrack onto
        (*COMMIT).</p>

        <h3>Backtracking verbs in repeated groups</h3>

        <p>PCRE2 differs from Perl in its handling of backtracking
        verbs in repeated groups. For example, consider:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/(a(*COMMIT)b)+ac/
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>If the subject is "abac", Perl matches, but PCRE2 fails
        because the (*COMMIT) in the second repeat of the group
        acts.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Backtracking verbs in assertions</h3>

        <p>(*FAIL) in an assertion has its normal effect: it forces
        an immediate backtrack.</p>

        <p>(*ACCEPT) in a positive assertion causes the assertion
        to succeed without any further processing. In a negative
        assertion, (*ACCEPT) causes the assertion to fail without
        any further processing.</p>

        <p>The other backtracking verbs are not treated specially
        if they appear in a positive assertion. In particular,
        (*THEN) skips to the next alternative in the innermost
        enclosing group that has alternations, whether or not this
        is within the assertion.</p>

        <p>Negative assertions are, however, different, in order to
        ensure that changing a positive assertion into a negative
        assertion changes its result. Backtracking into (*COMMIT),
        (*SKIP), or (*PRUNE) causes a negative assertion to be
        true, without considering any further alternative branches
        in the assertion. Backtracking into (*THEN) causes it to
        skip to the next enclosing alternative within the assertion
        (the normal behaviour), but if the assertion does not have
        such an alternative, (*THEN) behaves like (*PRUNE).</p>

        <h3>Backtracking verbs in subroutines</h3>

        <p>These behaviours occur whether or not the subpattern is
        called recursively. Perl's treatment of subroutines is
        different in some cases.</p>

        <p>(*FAIL) in a subpattern called as a subroutine has its
        normal effect: it forces an immediate backtrack.</p>

        <p>(*ACCEPT) in a subpattern called as a subroutine causes
        the subroutine match to succeed without any further
        processing. Matching then continues after the subroutine
        call.</p>

        <p>(*COMMIT), (*SKIP), and (*PRUNE) in a subpattern called
        as a subroutine cause the subroutine match to fail.</p>

        <p>(*THEN) skips to the next alternative in the innermost
        enclosing group within the subpattern that has
        alternatives. If there is no such group within the
        subpattern, (*THEN) causes the subroutine match to
        fail.</p>
