      <h2>PCRE2 PERFORMANCE</h2>

      <p>Two aspects of performance are discussed below: memory
      usage and processing time. The way you express your pattern
      as a regular expression can affect both of them.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>COMPILED PATTERN MEMORY USAGE</h2>

      <p>Patterns are compiled by PCRE2 into a reasonably efficient
      interpretive code, so that most simple patterns do not use
      much memory. However, there is one case where the memory
      usage of a compiled pattern can be unexpectedly large. If a
      parenthesized subpattern has a quantifier with a minimum
      greater than 1 and/or a limited maximum, the whole subpattern
      is repeated in the compiled code. For example, the
      pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc|def){2,4}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>is compiled as if it were</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(abc|def)(abc|def)((abc|def)(abc|def)?)?
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>(Technical aside: It is done this way so that backtrack
      points within each of the repetitions can be independently
      maintained.)</p>

      <p>For regular expressions whose quantifiers use only small
      numbers, this is not usually a problem. However, if the
      numbers are large, and particularly if such repetitions are
      nested, the memory usage can become an embarrassment. For
      example, the very simple pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
((ab){1,1000}c){1,3}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>uses 51K bytes when compiled using the 8-bit library. When
      PCRE2 is compiled with its default internal pointer size of
      two bytes, the size limit on a compiled pattern is 64K code
      units in the 8-bit and 16-bit libraries, and this is reached
      with the above pattern if the outer repetition is increased
      from 3 to 4. PCRE2 can be compiled to use larger internal
      pointers and thus handle larger compiled patterns, but it is
      better to try to rewrite your pattern to use less memory if
      you can.</p>

      <p>One way of reducing the memory usage for such patterns is
      to make use of PCRE2's "subroutine" facility. Re-writing the
      above pattern as</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
((ab)(?2){0,999}c)(?1){0,2}
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>reduces the memory requirements to 18K, and indeed it
      remains under 20K even with the outer repetition increased to
      100. However, this pattern is not exactly equivalent, because
      the "subroutine" calls are treated as atomic groups into
      which there can be no backtracking if there is a subsequent
      matching failure. Therefore, PCRE2 cannot do this kind of
      rewriting automatically. Furthermore, there is a noticeable
      loss of speed when executing the modified pattern.
      Nevertheless, if the atomic grouping is not a problem and the
      loss of speed is acceptable, this kind of rewriting will
      allow you to process patterns that PCRE2 cannot otherwise
      handle.</p>

      <h2>STACK USAGE AT RUN TIME</h2>

      <p>When <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is used
      for matching, certain kinds of pattern can cause it to use
      large amounts of the process stack. In some environments the
      default process stack is quite small, and if it runs out the
      result is often SIGSEGV. Rewriting your pattern can often
      help. The <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2stack.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2stack</span>(3)</span></a> documentation
      discusses this issue in detail.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2perform-3_sect4" name="pcre2perform-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>PROCESSING TIME</h2>

      <p>Certain items in regular expression patterns are processed
      more efficiently than others. It is more efficient to use a
      character class like [aeiou] than a set of single-character
      alternatives such as (a|e|i|o|u). In general, the simplest
      construction that provides the required behaviour is usually
      the most efficient. Jeffrey Friedl's book contains a lot of
      useful general discussion about optimizing regular
      expressions for efficient performance. This document contains
      a few observations about PCRE2.</p>

      <p>Using Unicode character properties (the \p, \P, and \X
      escapes) is slow, because PCRE2 has to use a multi-stage
      table lookup whenever it needs a character's property. If you
      can find an alternative pattern that does not use character
      properties, it will probably be faster.</p>

      <p>By default, the escape sequences \b, \d, \s, and \w, and
      the POSIX character classes such as [:alpha:] do not use
      Unicode properties, partly for backwards compatibility, and
      partly for performance reasons. However, you can set the
      PCRE2_UCP option or start the pattern with (*UCP) if you want
      Unicode character properties to be used. This can double the
      matching time for items such as \d, when matched with
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(); the performance
      loss is less with a DFA matching function, and in both cases
      there is not much difference for \b.</p>

      <p>When a pattern begins with .* not in atomic parentheses,
      nor in parentheses that are the subject of a backreference,
      and the PCRE2_DOTALL option is set, the pattern is implicitly
      anchored by PCRE2, since it can match only at the start of a
      subject string. If the pattern has multiple top-level
      branches, they must all be anchorable. The optimization can
      be disabled by the PCRE2_NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR option, and is
      automatically disabled if the pattern contains (*PRUNE) or
      (*SKIP).</p>

      <p>If PCRE2_DOTALL is not set, PCRE2 cannot make this
      optimization, because the dot metacharacter does not then
      match a newline, and if the subject string contains newlines,
      the pattern may match from the character immediately
      following one of them instead of from the very start. For
      example, the pattern</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
.*second
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>matches the subject "first\nand second" (where \n stands
      for a newline character), with the match starting at the
      seventh character. In order to do this, PCRE2 has to retry
      the match starting after every newline in the subject.</p>

      <p>If you are using such a pattern with subject strings that
      do not contain newlines, the best performance is obtained by
      setting PCRE2_DOTALL, or starting the pattern with ^.* or
      ^.*? to indicate explicit anchoring. That saves PCRE2 from
      having to scan along the subject looking for a newline to
      restart at.</p>

      <p>Beware of patterns that contain nested indefinite repeats.
      These can take a long time to run when applied to a string
      that does not match. Consider the pattern fragment</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^(a+)*
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>This can match "aaaa" in 16 different ways, and this
      number increases very rapidly as the string gets longer. (The
      * repeat can match 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 times, and for each of
      those cases other than 0 or 4, the + repeats can match
      different numbers of times.) When the remainder of the
      pattern is such that the entire match is going to fail, PCRE2
      has in principle to try every possible variation, and this
      can take an extremely long time, even for relatively short
      strings.</p>

      <p>An optimization catches some of the more simple cases such
      as</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a+)*b
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>where a literal character follows. Before embarking on the
      standard matching procedure, PCRE2 checks that there is a "b"
      later in the subject string, and if there is not, it fails
      the match immediately. However, when there is no following
      literal this optimization cannot be used. You can see the
      difference by comparing the behaviour of</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
(a+)*\d
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>with the pattern above. The former gives a failure almost
      instantly when applied to a whole line of "a" characters,
      whereas the latter takes an appreciable time with strings
      longer than about 20 characters.</p>

      <p>In many cases, the solution to this kind of performance
      issue is to use an atomic group or a possessive
      quantifier.</p>
