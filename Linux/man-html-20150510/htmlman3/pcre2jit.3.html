      <h2>PCRE2 JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>Just-in-time compiling is a heavyweight optimization that
      can greatly speed up pattern matching. However, it comes at
      the cost of extra processing before the match is performed,
      so it is of most benefit when the same pattern is going to be
      matched many times. This does not necessarily mean many calls
      of a matching function; if the pattern is not anchored,
      matching attempts may take place many times at various
      positions in the subject, even for a single call. Therefore,
      if the subject string is very long, it may still pay to use
      JIT even for one-off matches. JIT support is available for
      all of the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit PCRE2 libraries.</p>

      <p>JIT support applies only to the traditional
      Perl-compatible matching function. It does not apply when the
      DFA matching function is being used. The code for this
      support was written by Zoltan Herczeg.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2jit-3_sect2" name="pcre2jit-3_sect2" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>AVAILABILITY OF JIT SUPPORT</h2>

      <p>JIT support is an optional feature of PCRE2. The
      "configure" option --enable-jit (or equivalent CMake option)
      must be set when PCRE2 is built if you want to use JIT. The
      support is limited to the following hardware platforms:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 ARM 32-bit (v5, v7, and Thumb2)
 ARM 64-bit
 Intel x86 32-bit and 64-bit
 MIPS 32-bit and 64-bit
 Power PC 32-bit and 64-bit
 SPARC 32-bit
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>If --enable-jit is set on an unsupported platform,
      compilation fails.</p>

      <p>A program can tell if JIT support is available by calling
      <code class="function">pcre2_config</code>() with the
      PCRE2_CONFIG_JIT option. The result is 1 when JIT is
      available, and 0 otherwise. However, a simple program does
      not need to check this in order to use JIT. The API is
      implemented in a way that falls back to the interpretive code
      if JIT is not available. For programs that need the best
      possible performance, there is also a "fast path" API that is
      JIT-specific.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2jit-3_sect3" name="pcre2jit-3_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>SIMPLE USE OF JIT</h2>

      <p>To make use of the JIT support in the simplest way, all
      you have to do is to call <code class="function">pcre2_jit_compile</code>() after successfully
      compiling a pattern with <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(). This function has two
      arguments: the first is the compiled pattern pointer that was
      returned by <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(),
      and the second is zero or more of the following option bits:
      PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE, PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD, or
      PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT.</p>

      <p>If JIT support is not available, a call to <code class="function">pcre2_jit_compile</code>() does nothing and
      returns PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_BADOPTION. Otherwise, the compiled
      pattern is passed to the JIT compiler, which turns it into
      machine code that executes much faster than the normal
      interpretive code, but yields exactly the same results. The
      returned value from <code class="function">pcre2_jit_compile</code>() is zero on success, or
      a negative error code.</p>

      <p>PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE requests the JIT compiler to generate
      code for complete matches. If you want to run partial matches
      using the PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD or PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT options of
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), you should set
      one or both of the other options as well as, or instead of
      PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE. The JIT compiler generates different
      optimized code for each of the three modes (normal, soft
      partial, hard partial). When <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is called, the appropriate
      code is run if it is available. Otherwise, the pattern is
      matched using interpretive code.</p>

      <p>You can call <code class="function">pcre2_jit_compile</code>() multiple times for the
      same compiled pattern. It does nothing if it has previously
      compiled code for any of the option bits. For example, you
      can call it once with PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE and (perhaps later,
      when you find you need partial matching) again with
      PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE and PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD. This time it
      will ignore PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE and just compile code for
      partial matching. If <code class="function">pcre2_jit_compile</code>() is called with no
      option bits set, it immediately returns zero. This is an
      alternative way of testing whether JIT is available.</p>

      <p>At present, it is not possible to free JIT compiled code
      except when the entire compiled pattern is freed by calling
      <code class="function">pcre2_code_free</code>().</p>

      <p>In some circumstances you may need to call additional
      functions. These are described in the section entitled
      "Controlling the JIT stack" below.</p>

      <p>There are some <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>()
      options that are not supported by JIT, and there are also
      some pattern items that JIT cannot handle. Details are given
      below. In both cases, matching automatically falls back to
      the interpretive code. If you want to know whether JIT was
      actually used for a particular match, you should arrange for
      a JIT callback function to be set up as described in the
      section entitled "Controlling the JIT stack" below, even if
      you do not need to supply a non-default JIT stack. Such a
      callback function is called whenever JIT code is about to be
      obeyed. If the match-time options are not right for JIT
      execution, the callback function is not obeyed.</p>

      <p>If the JIT compiler finds an unsupported item, no JIT data
      is generated. You can find out if JIT matching is available
      after compiling a pattern by calling <code class="function">pcre2_pattern_info</code>() with the
      PCRE2_INFO_JITSIZE option. A non-zero result means that JIT
      compilation was successful. A result of 0 means that JIT
      support is not available, or the pattern was not processed by
      <code class="function">pcre2_jit_compile</code>(), or the JIT
      compiler was not able to handle the pattern.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2jit-3_sect4" name="pcre2jit-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>UNSUPPORTED OPTIONS AND PATTERN ITEMS</h2>

      <p>The <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() options
      that are supported for JIT matching are PCRE2_NOTBOL,
      PCRE2_NOTEOL, PCRE2_NOTEMPTY, PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART,
      PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK, PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD, and
      PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT. The PCRE2_ANCHORED option is not
      supported at match time.</p>

      <p>The only unsupported pattern items are \C (match a single
      data unit) when running in a UTF mode, and a callout
      immediately before an assertion condition in a conditional
      group.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2jit-3_sect5" name="pcre2jit-3_sect5" shape="rect"> </a>

      <h2>RETURN VALUES FROM JIT MATCHING</h2>

      <p>When a pattern is matched using JIT matching, the return
      values are the same as those given by the interpretive
      <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() code, with the
      addition of one new error code: PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_STACKLIMIT.
      This means that the memory used for the JIT stack was
      insufficient. See "Controlling the JIT stack" below for a
      discussion of JIT stack usage.</p>

      <p>The error code PCRE2_ERROR_MATCHLIMIT is returned by the
      JIT code if searching a very large pattern tree goes on for
      too long, as it is in the same circumstance when JIT is not
      used, but the details of exactly what is counted are not the
      same. The PCRE2_ERROR_RECURSIONLIMIT error code is never
      returned when JIT matching is used.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>CONTROLLING THE JIT STACK</h2>

      <p>When the compiled JIT code runs, it needs a block of
      memory to use as a stack. By default, it uses 32K on the
      machine stack. However, some large or complicated patterns
      need more than this. The error PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_STACKLIMIT is
      given when there is not enough stack. Three functions are
      provided for managing blocks of memory for use as JIT stacks.
      There is further discussion about the use of JIT stacks in
      the section entitled "JIT stack FAQ" below.</p>

      <p>The <code class="function">pcre2_jit_stack_create</code>()
      function creates a JIT stack. Its arguments are a starting
      size, a maximum size, and a general context (for memory
      allocation functions, or NULL for standard memory
      allocation). It returns a pointer to an opaque structure of
      type <code class="function">pcre2_jit_stack</code>, or NULL
      if there is an error. The <code class="function">pcre2_jit_stack_free</code>() function is used to
      free a stack that is no longer needed. (For the technically
      minded: the address space is allocated by mmap or
      VirtualAlloc.)</p>

      <p>JIT uses far less memory for recursion than the
      interpretive code, and a maximum stack size of 512K to 1M
      should be more than enough for any pattern.</p>

      <p>The <code class="function">pcre2_jit_stack_assign</code>()
      function specifies which stack JIT code should use. Its
      arguments are as follows:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 pcre2_match_context  *mcontext
 pcre2_jit_callback    callback
 void                 *data
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The first argument is a pointer to a match context. When
      this is subsequently passed to a matching function, its
      information determines which JIT stack is used. There are
      three cases for the values of the other two options:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (1) If <code class="function">callback</code> is NULL and <code class="function">data</code> is NULL, an internal 32K block
     on the machine stack is used. This is the default when a match
     context is created.
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (2) If <code class="function">callback</code> is NULL and <code class="function">data</code> is not NULL, <code class="function">data</code> must be
     a pointer to a valid JIT stack, the result of calling
     <code class="function">pcre2_jit_stack_create</code>().
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 (3) If <code class="function">callback</code> is not NULL, it must point to a function that is
     called with <code class="function">data</code> as an argument at the start of matching, in
     order to set up a JIT stack. If the return from the callback
     function is NULL, the internal 32K stack is used; otherwise the
     return value must be a valid JIT stack, the result of calling
     <code class="function">pcre2_jit_stack_create</code>().
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>A callback function is obeyed whenever JIT code is about
      to be run; it is not obeyed when <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is called with options that
      are incompatible for JIT matching. A callback function can
      therefore be used to determine whether a match operation was
      executed by JIT or by the interpreter.</p>

      <p>You may safely use the same JIT stack for more than one
      pattern (either by assigning directly or by callback), as
      long as the patterns are all matched sequentially in the same
      thread. In a multithread application, if you do not specify a
      JIT stack, or if you assign or pass back NULL from a
      callback, that is thread-safe, because each thread has its
      own machine stack. However, if you assign or pass back a
      non-NULL JIT stack, this must be a different stack for each
      thread so that the application is thread-safe.</p>

      <p>Strictly speaking, even more is allowed. You can assign
      the same non-NULL stack to a match context that is used by
      any number of patterns, as long as they are not used for
      matching by multiple threads at the same time. For example,
      you could use the same stack in all compiled patterns, with a
      global mutex in the callback to wait until the stack is
      available for use. However, this is an inefficient solution,
      and not recommended.</p>

      <p>This is a suggestion for how a multithreaded program that
      needs to set up non-default JIT stacks might operate:</p>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 During thread initalization
   thread_local_var = pcre2_jit_stack_create(...)
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 During thread exit
   pcre2_jit_stack_free(thread_local_var)
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 Use a one-line callback function
   return thread_local_var
</pre>
      </div>

      <p>All the functions described in this section do nothing if
      JIT is not available.</p>
    </div>

      <h2>JIT STACK FAQ</h2>

      <p>(1) Why do we need JIT stacks?</p>

      <p>PCRE2 (and JIT) is a recursive, depth-first engine, so it
      needs a stack where the local data of the current node is
      pushed before checking its child nodes. Allocating real
      machine stack on some platforms is difficult. For example,
      the stack chain needs to be updated every time if we extend
      the stack on PowerPC. Although it is possible, its updating
      time overhead decreases performance. So we do the recursion
      in memory.</p>

      <p>(2) Why don't we simply allocate blocks of memory with
      <code class="function">malloc</code>()?</p>

      <p>Modern operating systems have a nice feature: they can
      reserve an address space instead of allocating memory. We can
      safely allocate memory pages inside this address space, so
      the stack could grow without moving memory data (this is
      important because of pointers). Thus we can allocate 1M
      address space, and use only a single memory page (usually 4K)
      if that is enough. However, we can still grow up to 1M
      anytime if needed.</p>

      <p>(3) Who "owns" a JIT stack?</p>

      <p>The owner of the stack is the user program, not the JIT
      studied pattern or anything else. The user program must
      ensure that if a stack is being used by <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), (that is, it is assigned to
      a match context that is passed to the pattern currently
      running), that stack must not be used by any other threads
      (to avoid overwriting the same memory area). The best
      practice for multithreaded programs is to allocate a stack
      for each thread, and return this stack through the JIT
      callback function.</p>

      <p>(4) When should a JIT stack be freed?</p>

      <p>You can free a JIT stack at any time, as long as it will
      not be used by <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>()
      again. When you assign the stack to a match context, only a
      pointer is set. There is no reference counting or any other
      magic. You can free compiled patterns, contexts, and stacks
      in any order, anytime. Just <span class="emphasis"><em>do
      not</em></span> call <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() with a match context pointing
      to an already freed stack, as that will cause SEGFAULT.
      (Also, do not free a stack currently used by <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() in another thread). You can
      also replace the stack in a context at any time when it is
      not in use. You should free the previous stack before
      assigning a replacement.</p>

      <p>(5) Should I allocate/free a stack every time before/after
      calling <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>()?</p>

      <p>No, because this is too costly in terms of resources.
      However, you could implement some clever idea which release
      the stack if it is not used in let's say two minutes. The JIT
      callback can help to achieve this without keeping a list of
      patterns.</p>

      <p>(6) OK, the stack is for long term memory allocation. But
      what happens if a pattern causes stack overflow with a stack
      of 1M? Is that 1M kept until the stack is freed?</p>

      <p>Especially on embedded sytems, it might be a good idea to
      release memory sometimes without freeing the stack. There is
      no API for this at the moment. Probably a function call which
      returns with the currently allocated memory for any stack and
      another which allows releasing memory (shrinking the stack)
      would be a good idea if someone needs this.</p>

      <p>(7) This is too much of a headache. Isn't there any better
      solution for JIT stack handling?</p>

      <p>No, thanks to Windows. If POSIX threads were used
      everywhere, we could throw out this complicated API.</p>

      <h2>FREEING JIT SPECULATIVE MEMORY</h2>

      <div class="informalexample">

</pre>
      </div>

      <p>The JIT executable allocator does not free all memory when
      it is possible. It expects new allocations, and keeps some
      free memory around to improve allocation speed. However, in
      low memory conditions, it might be better to free all
      possible memory. You can cause this to happen by calling
      pcre2_jit_free_unused_memory(). Its argument is a general
      context, for custom memory management, or NULL for standard
      memory management.</p>

      <h2>EXAMPLE CODE</h2>

      <p>This is a single-threaded example that specifies a JIT

      <h2>JIT FAST PATH API</h2>

      <p>Because the API described above falls back to interpreted
      matching when JIT is not available, it is convenient for
      programs that are written for general use in many
      environments. However, calling JIT via <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() does have a performance
      impact. Programs that are written for use where JIT is known
      to be available, and which need the best possible
      performance, can instead use a "fast path" API to call JIT
      matching directly instead of calling <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() (obviously only for patterns
      that have been successfully processed by <code class="function">pcre2_jit_compile</code>()).</p>

      <p>The fast path function is called <code class="function">pcre2_jit_match</code>(), and it takes exactly the
      same arguments as <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(). The return values are also
      the same, plus PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_BADOPTION if a matching mode
      (partial or complete) is requested that was not compiled.
      Unsupported option bits (for example, PCRE2_ANCHORED) are
      ignored.</p>

      <p>When you call <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(),
      as well as testing for invalid options, a number of other
      sanity checks are performed on the arguments. For example, if
      the subject pointer is NULL, an immediate error is given.
      Also, unless PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK is set, a UTF subject string
      is tested for validity. In the interests of speed, these
      checks do not happen on the JIT fast path, and if invalid
      data is passed, the result is undefined.</p>

      <p>Bypassing the sanity checks and the <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() wrapping can give speedups of
      more than 10%.</p>
