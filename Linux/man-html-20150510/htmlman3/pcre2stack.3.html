      <h2>PCRE2 DISCUSSION OF STACK USAGE</h2>

      <p>When you call <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(),
      it makes use of an internal function called <code class="function">match</code>(). This calls itself recursively at
      branch points in the pattern, in order to remember the state
      of the match so that it can back up and try a different
      alternative after a failure. As matching proceeds deeper and
      deeper into the tree of possibilities, the recursion depth
      increases. The <code class="function">match</code>() function
      is also called in other circumstances, for example, whenever
      a parenthesized sub-pattern is entered, and in certain cases
      of repetition.</p>

      <p>Not all calls of <code class="function">match</code>()
      increase the recursion depth; for an item such as a* it may
      be called several times at the same level, after matching
      different numbers of a's. Furthermore, in a number of cases
      where the result of the recursive call would immediately be
      passed back as the result of the current call (a "tail
      recursion"), the function is just restarted instead.</p>

      <p>Each time the internal <code class="function">match</code>() function is called recursively, it
      uses memory from the process stack. For certain kinds of
      pattern and data, very large amounts of stack may be needed,
      despite the recognition of "tail recursion". Note that if
      PCRE2 is compiled with the -fsanitize=address option of the
      GCC compiler, the stack requirements are greatly
      increased.</p>

      <p>The above comments apply when <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is run in its normal
      interpretive manner. If the compiled pattern was processed by
      <code class="function">pcre2_jit_compile</code>(), and
      just-in-time compiling was successful, and the options passed
      to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() were not
      incompatible, the matching process uses the JIT-compiled code
      instead of the <code class="function">match</code>()
      function. In this case, the memory requirements are handled
      entirely differently. See the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2jit.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2jit</span>(3)</span></a> documentation
      for details.</p>

      <p>The <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>()
      function operates in a different way to <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>(), and uses recursion only when
      there is a regular expression recursion or subroutine call in
      the pattern. This includes the processing of assertion and
      "once-only" subpatterns, which are handled like subroutine
      calls. Normally, these are never very deep, and the limit on
      the complexity of <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() is controlled by the
      amount of workspace it is given. However, it is possible to
      write patterns with runaway infinite recursions; such
      patterns will cause <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>() to run out of stack. At
      present, there is no protection against this.</p>

      <p>The comments that follow do NOT apply to <code class="function">pcre2_dfa_match</code>(); they are relevant only
      for <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() without the
      JIT optimization.</p>

        <h3>Reducing <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>()'s
        stack usage</h3>

        <p>You can often reduce the amount of recursion, and
        therefore the amount of stack used, by modifying the
        pattern that is being matched. Consider, for example, this
        pattern:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
([^&lt;]|&lt;(?!inet))+
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>It matches from wherever it starts until it encounters
        "&lt;inet" or the end of the data, and is the kind of
        pattern that might be used when processing an XML file.
        Each iteration of the outer parentheses matches either one
        character that is not "&lt;" or a "&lt;" that is not
        followed by "inet". However, each time a parenthesis is
        processed, a recursion occurs, so this formulation uses a
        stack frame for each matched character. For a long string,
        a lot of stack is required. Consider now this rewritten
        pattern, which matches exactly the same strings:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
([^&lt;]++|&lt;(?!inet))+
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This uses very much less stack, because runs of
        characters that do not contain "&lt;" are "swallowed" in
        one item inside the parentheses. Recursion happens only
        when a "&lt;" character that is not followed by "inet" is
        encountered (and we assume this is relatively rare). A
        possessive quantifier is used to stop any backtracking into
        the runs of non-"&lt;" characters, but that is not related
        to stack usage.</p>

        <p>This example shows that one way of avoiding stack
        problems when matching long subject strings is to write
        repeated parenthesized subpatterns to match more than one
        character whenever possible.</p>

        <h3>Compiling PCRE2 to use heap instead of stack for
        <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>()</h3>

        <p>In environments where stack memory is constrained, you
        might want to compile PCRE2 to use heap memory instead of
        stack for remembering back-up points when <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is running. This makes it
        run more slowly, however. Details of how to do this are
        given in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2build.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2build</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation. When built in this way, instead of using the
        stack, PCRE2 gets memory for remembering backup points from
        the heap. By default, the memory is obtained by calling the
        system <code class="function">malloc</code>() function, but
        you can arrange to supply your own memory management
        function. For details, see the section entitled "The match
        context" in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation. Since the block sizes are always the same,
        it may be possible to implement customized a memory handler
        that is more efficient than the standard function. The
        memory blocks obtained for this purpose are retained and
        re-used if possible while <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is running. They are all
        freed just before it exits.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="refsect2">
        <a id="pcre2stack-3_sect4" name="pcre2stack-3_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>

        <h3>Limiting <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>()'s
        stack usage</h3>

        <p>You can set limits on the number of times the internal
        <code class="function">match</code>() function is called,
        both in total and recursively. If a limit is exceeded,
        <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() returns an
        error code. Setting suitable limits should prevent it from
        running out of stack. The default values of the limits are
        very large, and unlikely ever to operate. They can be
        changed when PCRE2 is built, and they can also be set when
        <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() is called. For
        details of these interfaces, see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2build.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2build</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation and the section entitled "The match context"
        in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a>
        documentation.</p>

        <p>As a very rough rule of thumb, you should reckon on
        about 500 bytes per recursion. Thus, if you want to limit
        your stack usage to 8Mb, you should set the limit at 16000
        recursions. A 64Mb stack, on the other hand, can support
        around 128000 recursions.</p>

        <p>The <code class="function">pcre2test</code> test program
        has a modifier called "find_limits" which, if applied to a
        subject line, causes it to find the smallest limits that
        allow a a pattern to match. This is done by calling
        <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() repeatedly with
        different limits.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Changing stack size in Unix-like systems</h3>

        <p>In Unix-like environments, there is not often a problem
        with the stack unless very long strings are involved,
        though the default limit on stack size varies from system
        to system. Values from 8Mb to 64Mb are common. You can find
        your default limit by running the command:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
ulimit -s
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>Unfortunately, the effect of running out of stack is
        often SIGSEGV, though sometimes a more explicit error
        message is given. You can normally increase the limit on
        stack size by code such as this:</p>

        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 struct rlimit rlim;
 getrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;rlim);
 rlim.rlim_cur = 100*1024*1024;
 setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;rlim);
</pre>
        </div>

        <p>This reads the current limits (soft and hard) using
        <code class="function">getrlimit</code>(), then attempts to
        increase the soft limit to 100Mb using <code class="function">setrlimit</code>(). You must do this before
        calling <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>().</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Changing stack size in Mac OS X</h3>

        <p>Using <code class="function">setrlimit</code>(), as
        described above, should also work on Mac OS X. It is also
        possible to set a stack size when linking a program. There
        is a discussion about stack sizes in Mac OS X at this web
        site: http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2005/qa1419.html.</p>
