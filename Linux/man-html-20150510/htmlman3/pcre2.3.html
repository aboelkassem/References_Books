      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

      <p>PCRE2 is the name used for a revised API for the PCRE
      library, which is a set of functions, written in C, that
      implement regular expression pattern matching using the same
      syntax and semantics as Perl, with just a few differences.
      Some features that appeared in Python and the original PCRE
      before they appeared in Perl are also available using the
      Python syntax. There is also some support for one or two .NET
      and Oniguruma syntax items, and there are options for
      requesting some minor changes that give better ECMAScript
      (aka JavaScript) compatibility.</p>

      <p>The source code for PCRE2 can be compiled to support
      8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit code units, which means that up to
      three separate libraries may be installed. The original work
      to extend PCRE to 16-bit and 32-bit code units was done by
      Zoltan Herczeg and Christian Persch, respectively. In all
      three cases, strings can be interpreted either as one
      character per code unit, or as UTF-encoded Unicode, with
      support for Unicode general category properties. Unicode
      support is optional at build time (but is the default).
      However, processing strings as UTF code units must be enabled
      explicitly at run time. The version of Unicode in use can be
      discovered by running</p>

      <p>pcre2test -C</p>

      <p>The three libraries contain identical sets of functions,
      with names ending in _8, _16, or _32, respectively (for
      example, <code class="function">pcre2_compile_8</code>()).
      However, by defining PCRE2_CODE_UNIT_WIDTH to be 8, 16, or
      32, a program that uses just one code unit width can be
      written using generic names such as <code class="function">pcre2_compile</code>(), and the documentation is
      written assuming that this is the case.</p>

      <p>In addition to the Perl-compatible matching function,
      PCRE2 contains an alternative function that matches the same
      compiled patterns in a different way. In certain
      circumstances, the alternative function has some advantages.
      For a discussion of the two matching algorithms, see the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2matching.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2matching</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

      <p>Details of exactly which Perl regular expression features
      are and are not supported by PCRE2 are given in separate
      documents. See the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a> and
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2compat.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2compat</span>(3)</span></a> pages. There
      is a syntax summary in the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2syntax.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2syntax</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

      <p>Some features of PCRE2 can be included, excluded, or
      changed when the library is built. The <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2_config()</span>(3)</span> function
      makes it possible for a client to discover which features are
      available. The features themselves are described in the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2build.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2build</span>(3)</span></a> page.
      Documentation about building PCRE2 for various operating
      systems can be found in the <code class="constant">README</code> and <em class="replaceable"><code>NON-AUTOTOOLS_BUILD</code></em> files in
      the source distribution.</p>

      <p>The libraries contains a number of undocumented internal
      functions and data tables that are used by more than one of
      the exported external functions, but which are not intended
      for use by external callers. Their names all begin with
      "_pcre2", which hopefully will not provoke any name clashes.
      In some environments, it is possible to control which
      external symbols are exported when a shared library is built,
      and in these cases the undocumented symbols are not
      exported.</p>

      <h2>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS</h2>

      <p>If you are using PCRE2 in a non-UTF application that
      permits users to supply arbitrary patterns for compilation,
      you should be aware of a feature that allows users to turn on
      UTF support from within a pattern. For example, an 8-bit
      pattern that begins with "(*UTF)" turns on UTF-8 mode, which
      interprets patterns and subjects as strings of UTF-8 code
      units instead of individual 8-bit characters. This causes
      both the pattern and any data against which it is matched to
      be checked for UTF-8 validity. If the data string is very
      long, such a check might use sufficiently many resources as
      to cause your application to lose performance.</p>

      <p>One way of guarding against this possibility is to use the
      <code class="function">pcre2_pattern_info</code>() function
      to check the compiled pattern's options for UTF.
      Alternatively, you can set the PCRE2_NEVER_UTF option at
      compile time. This causes an compile time error if a pattern
      contains a UTF-setting sequence.</p>

      <p>If your application is one that supports UTF, be aware
      that validity checking can take time. If the same data string
      is to be matched many times, you can use the
      PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK option for the second and subsequent
      matches to avoid running redundant checks.</p>

      <p>Another way that performance can be hit is by running a
      pattern that has a very large search tree against a string
      that will never match. Nested unlimited repeats in a pattern
      are a common example. PCRE2 provides some protection against
      this: see the <code class="function">pcre2_set_match_limit</code>() function in the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2api.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2api</span>(3)</span></a> page.</p>

      <h2>USER DOCUMENTATION</h2>

      <p>The user documentation for PCRE2 comprises a number of
      different sections. In the "man" format, each of these is a
      separate "man page". In the HTML format, each is a separate
      page, linked from the index page. In the plain text format,
      the descriptions of the <code class="function">pcre2grep</code> and <code class="function">pcre2test</code> programs are in files called
      <em class="replaceable"><code>pcre2grep.txt</code></em> and
      <em class="replaceable"><code>pcre2test.txt</code></em>,
      respectively. The remaining sections, except for the
      <code class="function">pcre2demo</code> section (which is a
      program listing), and the short pages for individual
      functions, are concatenated in <em class="replaceable"><code>pcre2.txt</code></em>, for ease of
      searching. The sections are as follows:</p>
